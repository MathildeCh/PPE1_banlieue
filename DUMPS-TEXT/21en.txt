   A man has been arrested after a kidnapping ended in a car crash on the
   corner of Richardson and Maioro roads in the Auckland suburb of New
   Windsor on Sunday night.

   A man has been charged by police after a kidnapping ended in a car
   crash in the Auckland suburb of New Windsor on Sunday night.

   The 20-year-old man allegedly took the victim from a Methuen Rd address
   to a nearby cash machine and forced them to withdraw money before being
   chased by police.

   Police said one of their helicopters spotted the car in Stoddard Rd and
   followed it.

   “The offender refused to stop his vehicle after being sighted by police
   and crashed a short time later, colliding with a member of the public’s
   vehicle at the intersection of Richardson and Maioro roads,” Detective
   Senior Sergeant Steve Anderson said.

   The man allegedly tried to run but was caught by police, leaving the
   kidnapped victim in the car with minor injuries.

   Resident Mark Lewis said he heard “three loud bangs” just before
   11.30pm.

   “We get so many smashes around here that you become numb to them, but
   this made me step back and say, shit what was that?” he said.
   On Monday afternoon debris remained at the site of the crash.

   On Monday afternoon debris remained at the site of the crash.

   Lewis said he grabbed a first aid kit and ran up the road, where he saw
   one car with the front “completely blown off” and a second had gone
   through a fence.

   “I’ve never seen police respond so quickly. There must have been five
   or six police cars here within minutes,” Lewis said.

   The family whose fence was crashed into confirmed they were unharmed by
   the incident, but added they are “just really pissed off about the
   whole thing”.

   The impact of the crash was so intense that the tiles of the footpath
   had shifted.

   The impact of the crash was so intense that the tiles of the footpath
   had shifted.

   The man charged will appear in the Auckland District Court on Monday on
   charges of kidnapping, unlawfully taking a vehicle, aggravated robbery,
   threatening to kill and dangerous driving.

   “As the seriousness of these charges indicate, this was an extremely
   distressing incident for all those involved.

   “We are still in the early stages of our investigation and want to
   reassure the community we are not looking for anyone else in relation
   to last night’s events,” Anderson said.

   Anyone who has any information which could help police can contact 105
   and quote file number 220926/7713 or information can also be passed on
   anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.
