   Oct. 22 (UPI) -- A Michigan art dealer was arrested earlier this month
   and charged for allegedly scamming seniors out of more than $1.6
   million in profit from selling art they owned at her gallery in the
   Detroit suburb of Birmingham.

   Wendy Halsted Beard, the owner and operator of The Wendy Halsted
   Gallery, was arrested by FBI agents on Oct. 14 and charged with wire
   fraud and mail fraud, the FBI announced in a statement Friday while
   seeking potential victims.

   Investigators said Beard had taken fine art photography on consignment
   and sold them while pocketing the profits. She has also been accused of
   selling artwork to a victim but never delivering it after receiving
   payment.

   Court documents obtained by UPI show that Beard posted a $10,000 bond
   on the day of her arrest. It was not immediately clear if she has since
   been released from custody.

   The FBI alleged in court documents that Beard, who inherited the
   gallery from her father, had carried out her scheme to defraud victims
   since 2017. Her father, Thomas Halsted, died in 2018.

   The investigation into Beard began when the Birmingham Police
   Department received multiple complaints alleging that the art dealer
   had never returned photographs at the end of the period of consignment.
   Birmingham police referred the complaints to the FBI.

   "Throughout the course of the investigation, potentially dozens of
   victims were identified, this affidavit highlights just a few of these
   victims' interactions with Beard," an FBI agent wrote in the court
   documents.

   Artwork sold by Beard included a "mural-sized" photograph by Ansel
   Adams titled "The Tetons and the Snake River, Grand Teton National
   Park, 1942."

   It was among nearly $1 million in fine art photographs taken on
   consignment from an 82-year-old victim, identified in court documents
   as Victim 1.

   The photograph was allegedly sold for $440,000 and had previously been
   appraised with a value of $625,000 in 2016.

   The victim provided the FBI with emails in which Beard had said she had
   taken the print to try to sell it in Jackson, Wyoming, but was not
   successful.

   When the consignment period expired, Beard signed a consignment
   agreement with a gallery in Jackson to sell the print, which the
   gallery purchased on behalf of a private collector, the FBI said.

   Bank records show that a $440,000 interstate wire transfer was sent for
   the purchase in June 2020.

   The print changed hands a few more times before it was ultimately
   bought by a private client for $685,000 to be displayed at their
   residence in Idaho.

   "According to Victim 1, they were never notified by Beard of the sale
   of their Ansel Adams's photograph, and they subsequently never received
   any proceeds of the sale," court documents read.

   "Victim 1 made multiple attempts to have their photographs returned by
   Beard, who provided Victim 1 with excuses on why the artwork could not
   be returned. Often the excuses were pertaining to Beard's alleged poor
   pulmonary health conditions."

   Court documents show that Beard used alias email accounts purporting to
   be assistants at the gallery when she allegedly claimed to have
   undergone a double lung transplant as an excuse for not returning the
   artwork to the owner.

   "Multiple victim's reported receiving messages from these email
   accounts with statements claiming Beard was in the hospital or in a
   coma and could not be contacted directly," the FBI agent wrote in the
   court documents.

   "Based on my experience and training, I believe Beard created these and
   other fictitious assistants and email addresses in furtherance of the
   fraud and to create sympathy from her victims and justify why she had
   not returned their artwork."

   The FBI said in court documents that there is no record of Beard ever
   having been the recipient of a donated organ.

   Beard is also accused of having stolen a photograph by Ansel Adams
   after it was taken on consignment from an 89-year-old man with
   Alzheimer's disease, prosecutors said.

   That victim, identified as Victim 2, had also given Beard pictures by
   other renowned artists including Ion Zupco, Arnold Newman and Jerry
   Uelsma.

   When the victim sought to have the photographs returned, Beard dropped
   the photographs off at a local framer to be framed. When the victim's
   family received the pictures back from the framers, they noticed that
   the signed Ansel Adams photograph, titled "Tenaya Creek," was missing
   his signature.

   "Further, a second image purporting to be a signed photograph by Ansel
   Adams titled 'Siesta Lake Portfolio' was, in actuality, an altogether
   different Ansel Adams photo known as 'Moon and Half Dome,'" the court
   documents read.

   Detectives with the Birmingham Police Department interviewed Beard at
   her residence in May and she agreed to return the two Ansel Adams
   photographs to Victim 2.

   "Beard walked into another room of Beard's residence and retrieved
   three wrapped and framed photographs, insisting they were the missing
   photographs belonging to Victim 2," the court documents read.

   "The detective unwrapped the photos, determined they were still the
   incorrect pictures, and left without taking any photographs."

   Beard dropped off two photographs to Birmingham police in June, which
   were sent to the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite, California for
   authentication. The gallery said that the two pictures prints she
   provided were reproduction prints that could be purchased in its gift
   shop for $375 each.

   The FBI obtained records from Paypal that show Beard bought a
   photograph titled "Tenaya Creek, Dogwood, Rain - Unframed / No Color"
   from the Ansel Adams Gallery for $405.26.

   The FBI added that numerous other victims were interviewed by FBI
   agents as a part of the investigation.

   "During the course of this investigation, over 100 rare fine art
   photographs with a combined estimated value of approximately $1.6
   million have been identified as being consigned to Beard and not
   returned or sold to victims without being delivered," the court
   documents read.

   "Bank records and other business records indicate there are likely be
   more victims who have yet to be interviewed."

   Those who may be a victim or have additional information about
   potential fraud involving this defendant are asked to contact the FBI
   at 1-800-CALL-FBI or submit a tip online.
