   Auckland police have responded to a series of burglaries overnight in
   several suburbs.

   About 3am a BP station on Manukau Road in the central suburb of Epsom
   was ram-raided, with vaping products stolen from the business.

   The BP station's staff members said this was the second time they had
   been targeted.

   A retail store 50km away in Pukekohe was also ram-raided.

   Police said they tried to stop the vehicle on State Highway 1, but it
   escaped.

   Police's Eagle helicopter was used to locate the car and it was spiked
   in the Manurewa area.

   Two teenagers, aged 13 and 14, have been taken into custody.

   In a separate incidents, windows of a dairy in the southern suburb of
   Takanini were smashed just after 2am.

   At 3.15am, a store on Alfred Street in central Auckland was broken into
   and goods were stolen.

   A police spokesperson said they were examining CCTV footage to see what
   had been stolen.

   Ten minutes later, at 3.40am, the windows of a New Lynn liquor store
   were smashed.

   Police said investigations were ongoing in all incidents.
