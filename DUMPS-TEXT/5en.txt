   WA police have vowed to crack down on criminal gangs following a fatal
   shooting in the northern Perth suburb of Gnangara yesterday, with
   detectives confirming the victim had links to bikie members.

Key points:

     * Police found a man dead at a workshop in Gnangara about 4pm on
       Thursday
     * The gang crime squad is assisting the homicide squad with their
       inquiries
     * Police believe the shooting was targeted and the shooter poses no
       threat to the community

   A 34-year-old man was found dead at a workshop premises on Sydney Road
   after being shot.

   Police say investigations are ongoing and no arrests have yet been
   made, but they reassured there was no active threat to the community,
   as it was a targeted attack.

   Commissioner Col Blanch said a number of search warrants had already
   been carried out, with more to come, to "send a clear message to those
   in the community that want to commit these acts of violence that it is
   not tolerated".

   "If people think that they can, in cold blood, shoot people in Western
   Australia, then the police will be coming for them."

'Toughest bikie and firearms laws in the nation'

   Police Minister Paul Papalia reiterated that Western Australia will
   continue to crack down hard on gang-related crime.

   "This type of act is exactly why the government is giving the Western
   Australian police the toughest bikie and firearms laws in the nation,"
   the minister said.

   As well as recent amendments to the firearm act and consorting
   legislation, Minister Papalia said the government was also working on
   amendments to the surveillance devices act and the criminal
   investigation act "to enable police to more effectively target outlaw
   motorcycle gangs and organised crime".

   Commissioner Blanch issued a direct warning to criminal gangs: "If you
   get out of line, you start doing things like this, then the gang crime
   squad will come for you".

Police appeal for witnesses

   Neighbours reported hearing several gunshots and say they saw both a
   car and a motorcycle leaving the scene shortly afterwards.

   The property where the shooting took place is a warehouse, which
   neighbours say is a shared workspace used by mechanics.

   The area is semi-rural, with small farms immediately surrounding the
   warehouse.

   Police are asking for anyone who was in the area between 1pm and 4pm on
   Thursday afternoon that might have information or any CCTV, dashcam or
   mobile phone footage, to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
