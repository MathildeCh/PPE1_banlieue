   Police Shoot, Kill Man With Knife in Seattle Suburb
   More

   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) — Police in the Seattle suburb of Federal Way
   shot and killed a man after he charged them with a knife on Sunday
   night, the city's police department said.

   The shooting occurred at the Federal Way Transit Center around 9 p.m.

   Federal Way police said they were called to the transit center after a
   man refused to get off a bus. Callers told 911 dispatchers that the
   man, believed to be in his 50s, appeared to be under the influence and
   experiencing a mental health crisis, KING 5 reports.

   A crisis negotiator arrived on the scene to de-escalate the situation,
   a police spokesperson said. During attempts to communicate and
   negotiate, the man tried to start the bus and drive away.

   When he got off the bus he charged officers with a knife, prompting
   police to shoot him, authorities said. The man died at the scene and no
   officers were injured, KING 5 reports.

   The officers involved in the shooting are on administrative leave,
   which is standard protocol, KING 5 reports.

   The Valley Independent Investigation Team, a multiagency team tasked
   with probing officer-involved shootings in south King County, is
   investigating the shooting.
