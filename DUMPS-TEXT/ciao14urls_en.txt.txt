   Philippine police on Tuesday announced the arrest of a suspect in the
   killing of a radio journalist who was known for criticizing President
   Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his immediate predecessor.

   The suspect, identified as Joel Estorial, 39, gave himself up to the
   Philippine National Police (PNP) and Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos
   and was charged with murder two weeks after seasoned radio broadcaster
   Percival Mabasa (also known as Percy Lapid) was gunned down in a suburb
   south of Manila, official said.

   Estorial surrendered “out of fear for personal safety following public
   disclosure of … CCTV footage revealing his face during the incident and
   naming him as [a] primary person of interest,” according to a statement
   from Abalos’ office.

   “This is a major breakthrough. He made an extra-judicial confession,
   duly assisted by counsel,” Abalos said, adding that the suspect had
   named three other accomplices who are subjects of “intensive follow-up
   operations.”

   The gun used to shoot Mabasa was recovered and “positively linked to
   the crime scene” by the police forensics laboratory, according to the
   national police.

   Estoral confessed that five others had allegedly participated in the
   planning and killing of the broadcaster, but he only managed to
   identify three.

   Mabasa, who worked for DWBL radio station, was ambushed on Oct. 3 as he
   drove his car toward a gated community in Las Pinas, a suburb in
   southern metro Manila. He was the latest in a long line of killings
   targeting members of the Philippine media.

   However, the motive for his murder remains unknown. Abalos did not
   answer reporters when they asked him about this on Tuesday.

   “Just give us a few more days. We have to get the mastermind, that’s
   very important. The investigation is ongoing right now, there are many
   more details. Let’s not jeopardize them,” he said.

   The suspect in custody was presented at the press briefing, where he
   spoke to reporters.

   Someone from inside the country’s main prison facility, whom Estoral
   did not identify, had ordered a hit on Mabasa, he said. He identified
   two brothers and a third man as fellow accomplices in the attack.

   “I was afraid and conscience-struck for the killing of Percy Lapid,”
   said a handcuffed Estorial, who wore a helmet and bullet-proof vest.

   “Our arrangement was for whoever got closest to Percy would be the one
   to fire the fatal shot, and I was in that position. I was threatened
   with death if I didn’t shoot Percy at that moment, so I did,” Estorial
   said.

   The team was paid 550,000 pesos (U.S. $9,300) for the hit, he told
   reporters.

   “I hope the family forgives me. I did not want to do it, I was just
   forced to do so,” he said.

   Mabasa’s family issued a statement Tuesday thanking the police and
   saying they hoped his killing would not become just another statistic
   among murders of Filipino journalists dating back decades.

   “We hope this development leads to the identification, arrest and
   prosecution of the mastermind,” the family said.

   The Southeast Asian nation ranks among the most dangerous countries for
   journalists worldwide. Dozens have been killed with impunity since the
   dictatorship of Marcos’ late father, Ferdinand E. Marcos, more than 36
   years ago.

   Mabasa’s commentaries were often bold and sharp as he sought to counter
   fake news spread on air as well as on social media. He had also hit out
   against a perceived attempt by supporters of the Marcos family to
   distort history and had been bitingly critical of the war on drugs by
   Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, which left thousands dead.
   During his six years in office, Duterte had said journalists were fair
   game if they were corrupt.

   The Duterte administration worked to close down broadcaster ABS-CBN
   Corp. and convict Maria Ressa, the chief executive of the news website
   Rappler who was later named a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, on
   cyber libel charges.

   Jeoffrey Maitem and Mark Navales in Cotabato City, southern
   Philippines, and Basilio Sepe in Manila contributed to this report.
