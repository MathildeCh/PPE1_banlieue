   Cleveland Police Probe Shooting Involving Suburban Officer
   More

   CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP) — Cleveland police are investigating a fatal
   shooting involving officers from the suburb of Maple Heights early
   Monday.

   A brief Cleveland police statement said its officers were called at
   around 4:15 a.m. “to assist Maple Heights Police who had been involved
   in an officer involved shooting."

   A man with a gunshot wound was taken to University Hospital and
   pronounced dead, the statement said, adding that no officers were
   injured and a gun was found at the scene.

   The name of the person who was killed and other details weren’t
   immediately released.

   The statement said Maple Heights police had been chasing a man in a
   vehicle they suspected of shooting into homes in the suburb.

   WEWS-TV reported that Maple Heights police had earlier responded to a
   home that was struck by about two dozen bullets. One shot also went
   through the front bedroom of a neighbor's home, narrowly missing a
   sleeping woman and child, the station reported. It was unclear whether
   anyone was injured.

   Neighbors said the home had also been the target of a drive-by shooting
   several months ago, the station reported.
