   Residents in a Dunedin suburb allegedly received a fake tsunami warning
   from a teenager with a loudhailer.

   Police are investigating after a teenager allegedly drove around a city
   suburb broadcasting a fake tsunami warning through a loudhailer.

   Residents of low-lying South Dunedin reported a vehicle driving around
   streets and someone urging them to move to higher ground, talking of a
   level five tsunami alert.

   The incident, which unfolded about 9.30pm on Thursday, sparked a police
   investigation, Senior Sergeant Anthony Bond said.

   With no confirmed tsunami, police issued a public statement saying it
   was a hoax.

   They later tracked a vehicle, and its 18-year-old driver to a Jackson
   St address.

   The teenager admitted to driving and playing loud music but denied
   mentioning the tsunami.

   The investigation continues.
