Denver suburb where Elijah McClain died ousts police chief

   By Associated Press
   Published: Wednesday, April 6th, 2022 at 10:45AM
   Updated: Wednesday, April 6th, 2022 at 5:01PM

   FILE - Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson addresses members of the
   media to discuss a shooting at Nome Park on Nov. 15, 2021, in Aurora,
   Colo. The Denver suburb where a Black man died after being confronted
   by police in 2019 has ousted its police chief, Wednesday, April 6,
   2022, nearly two years after she took over vowing to rebuild community
   relations and reform the department. In a press release, Aurora's city
   manager implied that while Wilson prioritized community involvement,
   she didn't effectively manage the police department. (Helen H.
   Richardson/The Denver Post via AP, File)

   DENVER ‚Äî The Denver suburb where police officers and paramedics have
   been charged in the death of a Black man in 2019 ousted its
   reform-minded police chief Wednesday, faulting her management of a
   department at a time of rising crime and officer departures.

   However, lawyers for Vanessa Wilson, who became chief in Aurora in 2020
   after the death of Elijah McClain gained new attention amid protests
   over police brutality and racial injustice following the police killing
   of George Floyd, said she was the victim of a campaign to damage her
   reputation by conservative city council members who opposed reforms.

   Last year, the city signed an agreement with State Attorney General
   Phil Weiser to make changes aimed at ending a pattern of racially
   biased policing and excessive force. Before that, Wilson also acted
   quickly to discipline and fire officers accused of misconduct,
   including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock
   McClain‚Äôs death.

   ‚ÄúIn an effort to justify getting rid of Chief Wilson, the City and
   Council have engaged in a conspiracy to leak misinformation to the
   media and falsely attribute responsibility for the department‚Äôs
   long-standing historical problems to Chief Wilson,‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs lawyers
   said.

   City Manager Jim Twombly said Wilson excelled in her community outreach
   work in Colorado‚Äôs third-largest city but he said he fired her because
   of concerns about her leadership and management of the department. He
   declined to give specific examples other than mentioning a backlog of
   thousands of crime reports, with the potential to delay investigations
   and arrests, that he said he first learned about last month, in a list
   of more general factors contributing to his decision. A report on the
   findings of a city-commissioned independent audit on the records
   backlog was issued Tuesday.

   Twombly also said he had ongoing conversations with officers in the
   department and was concerned about the number of officers who have
   left. When asked by a reporter, he said he was concerned about the rise
   in crime in the community but he did not attribute that to Wilson.

   ‚ÄúIt really comes down to a lack of confidence on my part for her to be
   able to lead the department,‚Äù he said.

   Twombly said Aurora would continue to uphold its consent decree
   agreement with the attorney general, signed in November, but some were
   skeptical.

   ‚ÄúAurora is already regressing soon after the ink has dried on the
   consent decree,‚Äù said Qusair Mohamedbhai, who represents McClain‚Äôs
   mother, Sheneen McClain, and Kyle Vinson, a Black man who was shown on
   video being pistol whipped by an Aurora police officer last year.

   The state lawmakers who represent Aurora, all Democrats, issued a
   statement saying Wilson‚Äôs firing will set back efforts to eliminate
   ‚Äúthe department‚Äôs longstanding pattern and practice of racist
   policing.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúHer firing in the middle of these efforts sends a terrible message to
   the police force and to the community about Aurora‚Äôs commitment to
   reforming these practices,‚Äù they said.
