   Area commander Dion Bennett at the reopening of the Wanuiomata Police
   Station on Tuesday.

   After a 10-year hiatus, Wainuiomata has a police station again, though
   the community was so effective at driving parliamentary protesters out
   of the Lower Hutt suburb earlier this year, police are joking they may
   not have much to do.

   When the anti-mandate protesters were driven off parliamentary grounds
   in March, many went to Wainuiomata hoping to occupy the marae. Instead,
   they were met by locals who made it clear they were not welcome.

   So when Te Awa Kairangi ​Hutt Valley area commander Dion Bennett​ was
   in Wainuiomata on Tuesday to reopen the police station which closed 10
   years ago.

   He joked he “doubted” the community needed a police presence after the
   locals chased the protesters away. The response was “magic” and showed
   what a community could achieve by working together.

   Bennett said returning it to a working station had not been straight
   forward. After 10 years, it required expensive modernising and there
   were also issues around staff safety.

   Locals had made it clear, there was a strong desire to have the police
   back in the rapidly growing suburb, he said.

   It would be open to the public on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons.

   Staff had been chosen for their strong background in community policing
   and he hoped their presence would build trust in the community.

   The Wainuiomata Police Station reopening has been welcomed by locals.

   The Wainuiomata Police Station reopening has been welcomed by locals.

   Hutt South MP Ginny Andersen, who had previously worked for the police,
   said it was clear public trust and confidence grew when police had a
   presence.

   Mayor Campbell Barry thanked Bennett for listening to locals.

   “What you are doing here today is sending a strong message about the
   importance of community policing and we really appreciate that.”

   Wellington District Commander of the Māori Wardens Gabriel Tupou​ said
   having police based in Wainuiomata was a major step forward.

   Sergeant Patrick Tangipo has lived in Wainuiomata for 17 years.

   Sergeant Patrick Tangipo has lived in Wainuiomata for 17 years.

   A public meeting in November 2020 over youth crime and gang tensions
   had highlighted the need for local police.

   The wardens were one of a number of community groups that would use the
   station, which would help build their presence in the community.

   Wainuiomata Marae manager Linda Olsen​ was “absolutely delighted” to
   have police back in the suburb.

   The marae preferred to work with local police and she was glad that she
   could now report problems, rather than ringing 105.

   The station will be run by Sergeant Patrick (Pat) Tangipo​, a
   Wainuiomata resident of 17 years.

   Appointed in February, he said it had been a slow process reopening the
   building and finding staff, especially when he was diverted away to
   deal with the parliamentary occupation.

   He was aware of unhappiness over the original closure and he said
   rebuilding relationships would be his first priority.

   “I will hold people accountable, but my preferred style of policing is
   to work with whānau in the community and set them up with the tools to
   be safe and feel safe.

   “I believe this can only be done by being in the community with
   whānau.”
