   Eighty-seven Naucalpan, Mexico, police officers are out of a job due to
   a corruption “purge” in that suburban municipality, the El Universal
   newspaper reported Tuesday.

   “This provision is implemented with strict adherence to the legal
   framework and full respect for human rights and the law and is based on
   a model for updating and modernizing the corporation to strengthen
   institutional capacities and implement strategies that improve security
   of the inhabitants,” Mayor Angelica Moya Marin told the newspaper, and
   also announced plans to recruit young people to join the force. "The
   aim is to recruit men and women with a vocation for service, who have
   training and professionalization schemes in order to maintain an
   environment of peace and tranquility in the municipality."

   According to the report, the officers were removed from their posts at
   the Municipal Preventative Police as a follow-up to Moya Marin’s
   anti-corruption and security program announced in June as “the first
   phase of the purge” for alleged crimes of extortion, robbery, and
   abuse.

   “Citizen complaints about corruption and abuses by municipal police are
   constant and for this reason we implement actions that allow us to
   combat the corruption of the police elements and promote honest
   conduct,” the mayor said.

   In June, she announced on her Facebook page several actions to battle
   the corruption, including the formation of a police anti-corruption
   unit, “neighborhood checkers,” development of an approved model of
   civic justice, police equipment and police academy monitoring to
   enhance security in the municipality.

   The report said that there were protests Monday regarding security in
   several of the city’s neighborhoods complaining about police abuses and
   asking for a change in personnel.

   [Police officers and commanders] only go to ask for money from shops
   and businesses in the area, but there is no security,” protestors told
   the news outlet.

   The municipality, formally called Naucalpan de Jurez, is one of 125
   suburban municipalities northwest of Mexico City with a population of
   about 800,000, according to Mapcarta.

   Moya Marin visited a Tesla service center in the city in April and said
   she wants companies to stay to grow the local economy.

   “It is up to the governments to create the right conditions to attract
   new investments and that companies like Tesla, which have already
   invested in our municipality, remain and increase their participation
   in the national market, for the creation of new jobs and reactivate the
   regional economy,” Tesmanian reported the mayor saying during the
   visit.
