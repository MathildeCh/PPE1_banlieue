   Mass shootingAn 'idyllic suburban Jewish capital'

What you need to know about Highland Park, the Chicago suburb rattled by July
4 shooting

According to a 2020 study of the metropolitan Chicago area by researchers at
Brandeis University and the University of Chicago, Highland Park is 50%
Jewish.

   (JTA) — In 2014, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency included Highland Park
   in an article on communities across the country that were melding
   Jewish pride into their ceremonies for July 4, which that year fell on
   Friday, just before Shabbat.

   Locals were used to seeing a 1953 pickup truck drive through their
   suburb and others along Chicago’s North Shore blaring a mashup of the
   song “Yankee Doodle Boy” with a niggun, or wordless melody, written by
   the noted Orthodox singer-songwriter Shlomo Carlebach.

   The director of a local synagogue said he passed out both American and
   Israeli flags along the North Shore parade route. “In Highland Park,”
   he told JTA, “they prefer the Israeli flag.”

   The report captures Highland Park’s sky-high levels of Jewish pride and
   provides yet another example of how Monday’s shooting that killed at
   least seven people at a July 4 parade there struck the heart of one of
   the country’s idyllic suburban Jewish capitals. (One of the two victims
   identified so far, Jacki Sundheim, was the b’nei mitzvah and event
   coordinator for the North Shore Congregation Israel in the neighboring
   suburb of Glencoe.)

   The entire North Shore region — which stretches over 20 miles along
   Lake Michigan, approximately from Evanston up to Lake Bluff — is
   heavily Jewish, and other adjacent suburbs northwest of Chicago, such
   as Buffalo Grove and Skokie, are also known for their large Jewish
   populations. But Highland Park has the highest Jewish ratio of them
   all, and it was the original Chicago suburb that grew a substantial
   Jewish population in the early 20th century.

A Chicago area ‘Jerusalem’

   According to a 2020 study of the metropolitan Chicago area by
   researchers at Brandeis University and the University of Chicago,
   Highland Park is 50% Jewish: about 15,000 of the suburb’s 30,000
   residents. (About 3% of the Jews in Highland Park and its surrounding
   towns are Israeli, the study also found.)

   Thanks to its leading number of Jewish institutions — from camps to
   synagogues to a kosher butcher and other kosher restaurants — Highland
   Park is also still a destination for Jews throughout the North Shore,
   said Jay Tcath, executive vice president of Chicago’s Jewish United
   Fund federation.

   “While there are other Jewish concentrations elsewhere in the North
   Shore, Highland Park’s still the original. Highland Park is kind of
   still the Mecca, or Jerusalem, if you will,” Tcath said.

   Highland Park’s Jewish history dates back to the turn of the 20th
   century, when Tcath said Jewish families began spending parts of their
   summers in the area. The Lake Shore Country Club opened in 1908 as
   likely the only of its kind in the area to admit Jews in neighboring
   Glencoe, but Tcath said it was “primarily populated by [people from]
   Highland Park.” In 1918, the similar Northmoor Country Club opened in
   Highland Park proper.

   Some lamenting the tragedy on social media noted how the shooting
   punctured a very affluent, normally peaceful town where several iconic
   movies ostensibly about American suburbia — from “Ferris Bueller’s Day
   Off” to “Sixteen Candles” — were filmed. Highland Park’s median
   household income was $147,067 in 2020, according to the Census Bureau,
   more than twice the national median.

   “It’s a place of movie magic and one of the 100 wealthiest cities in
   America,” tweeted the noted film critic Richard Roeper. “No place is
   safe.”

Hockey bagels and other antisemitism

   The town has avoided large-scale antisemitic incidents throughout the
   20th century — even as nearby Skokie became the site of a nationwide
   neo-Nazi march and the center of a landmark Supreme Court case in the
   late 1970s, and as West Rogers Park on Chicago’s far northwest side saw
   a white supremacist shoot to kill multiple Orthodox Jews leaving
   services in 1999.

   Tcath said that the worst for Highland Park involved antisemitic hockey
   fans from neighboring towns, who in the 1980s and 90s would throw
   bagels onto the ice when their children played against Highland Park,
   to try to intimidate and embarrass them. In 2019, Highland Park High
   School yearbooks had to be edited to remove Nazi and white supremacist
   elements from multiple students’ comments. This past April, around the
   Yom HaShoah Holocaust Remembrance Day, antisemitic flyers were found
   scattered throughout Highland Park and other North Shore communities
   (they shared qualities with others distributed in several other cities
   over the past year by the antisemitic Goyim Defense League group).

Famous Highland Park Jews

   Highland Park’s Jewish population is comparable to Squirrel Hill, the
   Pittsburgh neighborhood where a white supremacist opened fire on the
   Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, killing 11 Jewish worshippers. Like
   Squirrel Hill — which is also home to almost exactly 15,000 Jews —
   Highland Park boasts an array of synagogues spanning denominations,
   including multiple Reform congregations and the largest
   Chabad-Lubavitch center in the area, called the Central Avenue
   Synagogue.

   It has also been the hometown for several famous Jews, from “Butch
   Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” screenwriter William Goldman to Olympic
   figure skater Jason Brown. (The non-Jewish Rachel Brosnahan, who is not
   Jewish but has said her upbringing around Jewish friends helped inform
   her performance as the very Jewish comedian Midge Maisel in the
   Emmy-winning Amazon TV series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” also hails
   from Highland Park.) Several Highland Park mayors, including the
   incumbent Nancy Rotering, have been Jewish.

   The town is rich in other 20th-century Jewish history, too. In 1967,
   Highland Park’s Congregation Solel flew a delegation into Washington,
   D.C., to protest the Vietnam War in what a JTA dispatch from the time
   called a historic move for an American congregation of any faith.
   Highland Park synagogue-goers were also active in the movement to free
   Soviet Jewry in the 1970s and 80s. Congregation Solel was led for a
   decade by Rabbi Robert Marx, a pioneering social justice activist who
   marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. and died last year at 93.

   While the Squirrel Hill shooter’s motive was clear, local police are
   still investigating the alleged Highland Park attacker, Robert “Bobby”
   Crimo III. Crimo’s father, Bob Crimo II, is a well-known local figure
   who owns multiple businesses, including a deli, and once unsuccessfully
   ran for mayor.

   Tcath said that while his organization and so many others are still
   looking into the younger Crimo’s background, Highland Park’s Jews are
   not reacting first with fears about a looming wave of specifically
   antisemitic violence. The town is heavily Democratic, and the fact that
   the incident was another of the 300-plus mass shootings in the United
   States so far in 2022 has many talking about gun reform.

   “People are shaken, but they’re not processing it as I was, or I am
   more at risk, because I live in Highland Park in particular,” Tcath
   said. “It’s being processed as, ‘This is yet another example of what
   America is today.’” PJC
