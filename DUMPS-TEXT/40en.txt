   The officer shot and wounded Portia Odufuwa, who was taken to a
   hospital after Monday's shooting at Dallas’ Love Field Airport.

   Odufuwa, who had no luggage, entered the ticketing area, then went into
   a restroom, emerging with her hands in the pockets of a hooded
   sweatshirt, according to the arrest warrant. She then went toward a
   ticket counter and witnesses reported hearing a disturbance before she
   shouted, “I'm going to blow this (obscenity) up!” and pulled a handgun.

   She fired two rounds in the ceiling and as she was confronted by a
   police officer, she fired in his direction, the arrest warrant said.
   The officer was not struck.

   Police were set to give a Tuesday afternoon news conference on the
   shooting. Jail records do not list an attorney who is representing her
   on the charge.

   Dallas police Chief Eddie Garcia has said Odufuwa was shot in her
   “lower extremities.” He said no one else was injured.

   Airport operations at Love Field, one of the Dallas-Fort Worth-area's
   two major airports, were suspended for hours and dozens of flights were
   canceled.

   Authorities have not released a motive for the shooting, but Odufuwa
   has been arrested several times in recent years and has been found
   incompetent for trial more than once.

   A judge last year found her incompetent to stand trial after she was
   charged with making a false report, court records show. The judge found
   that she wasn’t a danger to others and referred her to outpatient
   mental health services.

   In that case, she was accused of pulling a fire alarm at a hotel after
   the clerk refused to extend her stay, The Dallas Morning News reported,
   citing police. Records show the charge was dismissed.

   In 2019, she was found incompetent to stand trial after she was accused
   of robbing a bank in the Dallas suburb of Wylie. She underwent
   treatment, and court records show the case was eventually dismissed.

   Also that year, she was arrested for arson after telling a police
   officer who had responded to a house fire in the Dallas suburb of
   Mesquite that she started it and was “God’s prophet,” according to a
   police report. She also told police she was married to singer Chris
   Brown, the police report said. The Dallas County district attorney’s
   office said that charge was rejected for lack of scientific evidence to
   support a conviction.

   On Monday at the airport, she also was heard making comments about
   Brown, according to the arrest warrant.
