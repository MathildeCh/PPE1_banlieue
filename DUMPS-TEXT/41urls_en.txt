Informal settlement near Paris: 'Every morning, the police tell us to get
out'

   Roughly 300 migrants are camping out under the national highway in the
   Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis. Nearly every morning police officers
   order them to get out; and food distribution points keep getting pushed
   farther away from the heart of the French capital.

   There’s anger written on the faces of the the men who have been living
   in a camp under the A1 highway bridge in the northern Parisian suburb
   of Saint-Denis.

   This morning, as happens every morning, the police arrived around 6 am
   and ordered the migrants installed on the esplanade in front of the
   tricolor "UEFA Euro 2016" poster to "get out". Only the tents,
   installed on the dirt slope between the road and the esplanade, are
   allowed to stay.

   Surrounded by highways and major city thoroughfares, the camp has no
   benches to sit on, no toilets, and only one water point for about 300
   people. A single wooden chair has been placed in the middle of the
   camp, but no one seems to risk sitting on it.

   Distributions further and further away

   The camp right now has about 200 small tents, and every day, new ones
   are added. Volunteers from the French NGO Utopia 56 regularly visit the
   camp, which is inhabited by single men mostly hailing from Afghanistan.

   people in the camp. The others have left to get something to eat or to
   try to find a way to contact the Office of Integration and Immigration
   (Ofii) whose single phone line for asylum seekers is unreachable this
   morning.

   The further the migrant camps are from Paris, the more difficult it
   gets for people living there to access food and clothing distributions.
   From the Saint-Denis camp, migrants have to take the metro or walk
   almost an hour to reach the Saint-Ouen gate where the Salvation Army
   has moved its breakfast distribution since August 24.

   Breakfasts with access to information

   Breakfasts are an opportunity to fill stomachs and get hot beverages –
   and also to enjoy the small comforts of tables and benches set up next
   to the distribution stand. Asylum seekers can also take stock of their
   situation with France Terre d'Asile, a migrant rights NGO, which has
   installed a mobile truck a little further away. Some members of Utopia
   56 are also present to answer questions.

   Gulkhan, 25, and Taher, 16, look a little lost. The two friends from
   Afghanistan arrived from Germany the day before and were directed to
   the Saint-Denis camp by a friend of a friend. Utopia 56 explains to
   them that Taher has to go for an evaluation in order to assert his
   minority status and be taken into the care of the Children's Welfare
   Agency (ASE). The teenager with thick black curls and most of his face
   hidden behind a mask does not seem to believe it.

   Tonight, he will probably spend another night in the Saint-Denis camp
   with Gulkhan. Like all those unable to get a tent, the two Afghans will
   instead lie on a simple blanket on the ground next to the tents.

   They are the ones the police try to evacuate every morning. Sometimes,
   the operation is muscular. Khan, a 23-year-old Afghan dressed in a
   military camouflage-print outfit, says that a week earlier, the police
   used tear gas to dislodge migrants here.

   Safety fears

   "The hardest part is that the police come every morning and tell us to
   get out," he says. "Sometimes, outside people also come and attack us
   or pick fights to steal our phones," he says. To try to protect
   themselves, the migrants in the camp now organize guard tours. Khan 23

   Khan has been living in the camp for about a month after police on July
   29 evacuated a sprawling camp in the northern Parisian suburb of
   Aubervilliers. Having been denied asylum, Khan filed an appeal before
   the National Asylum Court (CNDA).

   The Saint-Denis camp also includes newcomers and "Dublinés" (after the
   Dublin Regulation that determines asylum applications in the EU) who
   have spent months, even years, crisscrossing Europe in search of
   international protection that no country wants to grant them.

   'Afghanistan is sinking, we have to flee'

   When asked why they left home, many Afghans invariably have the same
   reaction: a slow, pained smile followed by an intake of breath before
   offering a simple explanation, as one migrant who declined to be
   identified put it: "Afghanistan is sinking, we have to flee".

   Migrant aid associations regularly denounce the living conditions in
   the camps north of Paris and call for permanent accommodation solutions
   for asylum seekers.

   "The street is a school of madness as well as indignity," warned Pierre
   Henry, director general of France Terre d'Asile, in a recent interview
   with InfoMigrants.

   "We're waiting for the public authorities to think about a long-term
   solution," said Pierre Jothy, a social worker with Utopia 56, "If the
   only presence of the state for them is the police, who are always
   pushing them further away, that's not acceptable."

   So far, the state's response has been to dismantle migrant camps with
   police pushing migrants further away from Paris and deeper into the
   suburbs. Evacuations follow one after the other, and the camps are
   re-formed. The camp at Saint-Denis under the A1 highway is likely to be
   no exception.
