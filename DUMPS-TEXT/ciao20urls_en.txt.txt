   This is the huge haul of cannabis found after police raided a house in
   a leafy suburb of Cardiff.

   Officers smashed their way into the semi-detached property in Manor
   Way, Whitchurch, after an electricity firm noticed something suspicious
   was going on. As well as finding more than 300 cannabis plants,
   neighbourhood officers discovered sophisticated growing equipment in
   the house ⁠— which is on a main route into Cardiff.

   A South Wales Police spokesperson said the Class B drug farm was
   discovered after energy supplier E.ON noticed suspicious activity at
   the property. Officers have dismantled the operation.

   No one was inside the property when police entered. The force
   spokesperson added: "Cannabis remains illegal. Supply/production
   carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years."

   Although police are yet to make any arrests in connection to the bust,
   they have launched a public appeal. If you have any information which
   could help the investigation, you can call police on 101 and quote
   reference number *327705. You can read more of the latest news from
