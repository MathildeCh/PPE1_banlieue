   Winchmore Hill is a leafy suburb in the heart of Enfield in North
   London. It was once a small Medieval parish, thatʼs certainly still
   kept some of its historic features. Anyone visiting the area would be
   surprised to find out itʼs in London, as many residents say it feels
   like a village. The area does have its own village green, which is
   surrounded by independent shops, cafes, restaurants, and a pub.

   Many of the properties are Edwardian in character, and have an average
   price of around £700,000, according to Rightmove. But just off The
   Green is the famous and highly desirable Broad Walk, where house prices
   have sold for an average of £3,150,000. The road has often been called
   ʼmillionaires rowʼ. One of the houses was used as The X Factor house
   during the 10th series in 2013

   The suburb is around nine miles from Central London, and itʼs a popular
   choice for many commuters with excellent transport links. The
   neighbourhood has itʼs own station. It takes around 30 minutes to get
   to Moorgate on Great Northern services. Itʼs also in close reach of the
   Piccadilly line at Southgate, Arnos Grove, and Bounds Green.

   The neighbourhood was once a small Medieval hamlet in Edmonton, first
   mentioned from around 1319. Quakers were the main settlers in Winchmore
   Hill, and their 1790 meeting house is still used as a religious
   building today.

   Itʼs bordered by Grovelands Park, an expanse of green space with
   designated Grade II* listed status. Famous British architect, John
   Nash, designed the beautiful Grovelands House thatʼs located within the
   grounds of the park. Grovelands has tennis courts, bowling, fishing, a
   playground, pitches and an outdoor gym.

   The area is not only concentrated around The Green. It extends to
   Aldermans Hill in Palmers Green, and borders Edmonton. It also has some
   pretty famous residents. They reportedly include Baby Spice Emma
   Bunton, presenter and singer Myleene Klass, and singer Louise Redknapp.

   Councillors for the Winchmore Hill ward, Cllr Maria Alexandrou and Cllr
   Lee Chamberlain spoke about what makes the neighbourhood a great place
   to live in: "Winchmore Hill has transformed from a hamlet into a
   beautiful residential suburb adorned with lush greenery and mature tree
   lined streets.

   "The architectural style ranges include attractive Edwardian and
   Georgian houses with original features as well as quaint cottages and
   the imposing gothic design of St Paul’s Church. Broad Walk is the
   exquisite millionaire’s road in the area, bordering the local park.

   crown" (Image: Getty Images)

   "Grovelands Park is the jewel in Winchmore Hill’s crown. This leafy
   green suburb hosts a train station which still retains its charismatic
   timber canopy and has easy transport links to the city. The bus routes
   support travel to the local excellent schools. Winchmore Hill is one of
   the safest places and its picturesque rural setting is a welcoming
   place to reside."

   Charlie Menegatos owns Going Greek, a restaurant and takeaway business
   with one of five North London restaurants located on The Green in
   Winchmore Hill. He says the area is ʼcosyʼ and ʼfamily orientatedʼ,
   while everyone loves ʼto help one anotherʼ.

   He added: "Winchmore Hill has a very cosy/family orientated feel when
   it comes to owning a business in the area. Steps to pedestrianize The
   Green and make it a lovely al fresco dining area has also given
   Winchmore Hill a real boost."

   Havilands, an estate agents that operates in the area, said the
   Winchmore Hill property market has "always been in its own bubble" and
   buyers "come from all over London". A spokesperson continued: "During
   Covid the prices unexpectedly rose to limits we couldnʼt believe.

   "Winchmore Hill is known for its period homes from the Victorian and
   Edwardian era and there are plenty around. N21 also has some very
   premium roads, like Broad Walk, Seaforth Gardens, Branscombe Gardens
   and Eversley Crescent with its luxury detached homes that are rarely
   available for sale."

   Itʼs easy to see why Winchmore Hill was named one of the best places to
   live in the UK last year by The Times. The area has a lot to offer with
   good schools, lots to do, and great transport links. Havilands says the
   area is "the smaller version of its big brothers Crouch End and Muswell
   Hill," which are two other fashionable suburban neighbourhoods in North
   London.
