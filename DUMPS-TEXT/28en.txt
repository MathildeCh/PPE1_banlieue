   A manhunt is underway in Tennessee for an armed suspect who reportedly
   shot and wounded a police officer during a car chase Monday night,
   authorities said.

   Officers blanketed the area of Gibson Drive in Madison, a suburb in
   northeast Nashville, in search of the suspect, identified as
   34-year-old Samuel Quinton Edwards, the Metro Nashville Police
   Department said. Edwards has yet to be caught as of Tuesday morning.

   "Edwards should be considered armed and extremely dangerous," the
   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.

   The shooting unfolded during a pursuit that ended on Gibson Drive,
   according to investigators. Edwards allegedly fired shots at a
   Hendersonville police officer’s patrol vehicle, striking the officer.
