'No police, no law': anarchy in Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem

   September 2, 2022 — Jerusalem (AFP)

   One evening in January 2021, Arafe Rajabi, exasperated by yet another
   night of roaring cars below his window in an east Jerusalem Palestinian
   suburb, went downstairs to complain.

   Fifteen minutes later, he was shot dead, another victim of the chaos in
   his Kufr Aqab neighbourhood, a no-man's land which is increasingly
   turning into a local version of the Wild West.

   Located around 10 kilometres (six miles) from the centre of Jerusalem,
   the town is among a handful of locations with a unique status in the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

   Israel considers Kufr Aqab part of Jerusalem, which it fully controls
   after annexing the east of the city in the 1967 war. But to get there
   you need to cross an Israeli military checkpoint and pass a concrete
   wall several meters high which separates Jerusalem from the occupied
   West Bank.

   Tens of thousands of people live in the five-square-kilometre
   (two-square-mile) area, which lies behind the security barrier Israel
   began erecting in 2002 to protect it from deadly Palestinian attacks.

   Neither the Jerusalem municipality nor Israel's interior ministry could
   provide an updated number of Kufr Aqab's residents.

   Most residents have Israeli residency and pay their taxes to the
   Israeli-controlled municipality, allowing them to work in Israel.

   But another part of the neighbourhood is under the Palestinian
   Authority's jurisdiction, with Ramallah-based security forces
   prohibited from operating on the Israeli-annexed side.

   The Israeli police rarely venture into Kufr Aqab, and the lack of
   patrols creates the ideal conditions for crime, arms trade and drug
   trafficking, residents say.

   "There are non-stop gunshots, there is no authority, no police, no
   law," sighed Imane Rajabi, 37, who has been raising her four children
   alone since her husband, Arafe, was shot dead by residents armed with
   M16s.

   "It's a jungle, and you don't know who to complain to," she continued,
   saying it took Israeli police several days to act following her
   husband's death.

   Contacted by AFP, Israeli police said "several suspects were arrested
   and indictments were filed to court" over the killing.

   The police "constantly takes action all over Jerusalem, including in
   the eastern and northern neighbourhoods of the city and in Kufr Aqab,"
   they said in a statement.

   -'Lawless' zone -

   Israel, which annexed east Jerusalem following the 1967 Middle East
   war, considers Kufr Aqab an integral part of its territory, and most of
   its residents have Israeli residency

   But about 10 residents interviewed by AFP described a non-existent
   Israeli police presence and the near-total absence of municipal
   services.

   Besides a few Hebrew signs here and there, there was no indication of
   Israeli jurisdiction and Kufr Aqab, which continues to expand, seems to
   have been increasingly separated from Jerusalem and incorporated into
   the sprawling metropolis of Ramallah.

   In 2017, then-minister for Jerusalem affairs Zeev Elkin acknowledged
   the route taken by the Israeli barrier had been an "error" that had
   turned Kufr Aqab into a "lawless" zone.

   Bullet casings are strewn on the ground in the corner of an alley, and
   rubbish nobody bothers to collect can be found everywhere.

   On the main street, it is not uncommon to see vehicles driving in the
   wrong direction and motorcycles performing wheelies and stunts.
   Colourful billboards assail passers-by, and buildings sprout up without
   any regard to planning rules.

   "The place is up in the air, it doesn't really belong to Israel or the
   Palestinian Authority," said Ziyad Shahade, whose money exchange office
   overlooks the chaotic main road, with its incessant traffic jams and
   horns.

   The Jerusalem municipality told AFP that "despite the many challenges
   created by the erection of the security barrier," it was "doing
   everything in its power to provide [Kufr Aqab] inhabitants with all the
   services they needed and were entitled to."

   A section of Israel's controversial separation wall, erected by the
   Jewish state in 2002 to protect it from attacks, surrounding the Kufr
   Aqab suburb of east Jerusalem

   In reality, "the further away you move to the city centre in the
   direction of Ramallah the lower the level of services," said Daniel
   Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer and Jerusalem expert.

   "When you get to the wall," he said, "the level of municipal services
   collapses."

   The Palestinian Authority said it provided municipal services, but was
   unable to make up for Israeli shortcomings.

   - City limit's -

   According to Seidemann, when Israel seized east Jerusalem, it decided
   to include Kufr Aqab in the city's boundaries since it was sparsely
   populated and near an airport it wanted to use.

   But the airport ceased activity in 2001 during the Second Intifada, or
   Palestinian uprising, and the construction of the Israeli barrier was a
   move to "get rid" of Kufr Aqab by leaving it on the Palestinian side,
   according to the founder of the Israeli anti-settlement NGO Ir Amim.

   Israeli authorities have already considered removing Kufr Aqab from
   Jerusalem's municipal boundaries.

   But any such change in the city's limits would be seen as a potential
   segue to the division of Jerusalem, a red line for Israeli politicians,
   who consider the Holy City "the eternal and indivisible capital" of the
   Jewish state.

   Imane Rajabi says she has paid a heavy price for this nebulous status
   quo.

   Up to 20 years ago, Kufr Aqab was a place "without violence," and
   "without gunshots all day long."

   Now, she's considering leaving the neighbourhood with her children.
