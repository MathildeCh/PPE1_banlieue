Israeli at Highland Park parade recalls moment he realized fireworks were

   Chicago — An Israeli at yesterday’s Highland Park 4th of July parade
   recalls the first moments of the shooting in an interview with The
   Times of Israel, noting that responses to the incident from locals have
   seemed far more “drastic” than what they would have been had such an
   event taken place in Israel.

   Chaim Vachman moved with his family to the nearby suburb of Deerfield
   from the central Israeli town of Mazkeret Batya in 2019 and was at the
   Highland Park parade with his wife and seven-year-old daughter, less
   than 200 feet from where the bullets sprayed.

   Vachman, 45, says he did not register the initial gunshots, assuming
   they were fireworks, but realized that he was in the midst of a
   mass-shooting attack when he heard the gunman, Robert Crimo, lock in
   his second bullet magazine. He glanced at his wife who quickly ran with
   their daughter away from the shooting while Vachman stayed behind and
   took cover.

   Explaining his decision not to flee with the rest of the crowd, Vachman
   says, “I didn’t feel like the bullets were coming in my direction. If I
   ran away, I would be with my back to the incident, and I wouldn’t have
   been unable to properly respond.”

   The Israeli Navy veteran was armed at the time but did not draw his
   weapon, noting that there were already dozens of police officers there
   and that his doing so would have sparked more chaos.

   mass shooting at the Highland Park 4th of July parade on July 4, 2022.

   Vachman admits that gun carriers are relatively rare in the north shore
   suburbs. “Guns are seen as something impure, and people living here
   prefer to view it as a sterile bubble, regardless of the fact that
   seven other people were gunned down in Chicago on the same weekend.”

   The Israeli expat also notes how locals have had a much more difficult
   time processing the incident, given that such mass shootings are far
   less commonplace in Highland Park than in Israel.

   “People here are very emotional and easily have taken this kind of
   incident to all sorts of drastic directions,” Vachman says, pointing to
   announcements by nearby towns to cancel their respective 4th of July
   parades after news of the shooting broke and the decisions by locals to
   continue sheltering in place even after it was clear that the threat
   had subsided.

   “These reactions are human and happen everywhere, but in Israel, people
   are more used to this sort of thing and the circle of panic isn’t as
   wide,” he says.

   Still, Vachman says the experience has not changed his perception of
   the area or his family’s plans to stay in the Chicago area for the
   foreseeable future.
