Trump lost America’s suburbs. Now the GOP might be about to win them back

   Summerlin, Nevada CNN  —

   Republicans’ path to control of the US House winds through suburbs like
   the ones that ring the sprawling metropolis of Las Vegas here in
   Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, where Democratic Rep. Susie Lee is
   fighting for a third term.

   During the presidency of Donald Trump, the GOP lost significant ground
   in the suburbs as he alienated voters with his pugnacious style and
   self-serving rhetoric. Now the party is trying to win back many of
   those voters with a focus on crime and economic discontent, traversing
   suburban battlegrounds here in Nevada, which is home to three
   competitive House races, a high-profile gubernatorial race and a
   pivotal Senate contest.

   In the House, the GOP only needs a net gain of five seats to win, and
   their success – and the size of their potential majority – could hinge
   on turning out voters like 47-year-old Cindy Broussard, who works
   security at a local hotel and casino but took on a second job as a home
   health care aide to shoulder the crush of inflation.

   Interactive: Nevada, one of six states to watch for the 2022 midterms

   The Silver State’s tourism-fueled economy was pummeled by the Covid-19
   pandemic and it now has one of the highest inflation rates in the
   nation. Gas prices have dropped but are still above $5 a gallon – the
   fifth highest among the 50 states. That sour economic climate and
   concerns about rising crime have provided a clear opening for the GOP
   after an era in which disdain for Trump dramatically eroded their
   support among suburban voters, particularly women.

   “Everybody’s gone through their savings and beyond,” said Broussard,
   who is leaning toward Republican candidates this cycle, as she unloaded
   “the essentials” from her grocery cart on a recent afternoon. She has
   stopped buying soda. She has cut back on meat and condiments. She no
   longer contemplates splurging on the makings “for a great dinner” –
   just what she can afford to “survive and get through it.”

   “I’m literally working 84, 85 hours a week to cover the same bills,”
   Broussard said. She laughed when asked whether she expects to reap
   savings from the Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act,” the sweeping
   $750 billion health care, tax and climate law that Democrats say is
   intended to help put more money into the pockets of working Americans.

   “What is the reduction?” she asks. “You say you’ve done all these
   things,” she said of Democrats, “but where is it at?”

   Broussard’s frustrations encapsulate both the challenge facing
   Democrats and the opportunity for Republicans. Recent polling has shown
   that economic concerns are paramount – eclipsing all other issues,
   including abortion – and that was true in more than two dozen
   interviews with voters throughout the suburbs of Las Vegas.

   Political mood tilts in Republicans' favor with economy and inflation
   top of mind three weeks from midterms

   The Supreme Court’s decision overturning abortion rights in June helped
   Democrats close their enthusiasm gap, potentially boosting turnout on
   their side. But independent voters continue to prioritize the economy.
   And several Republican strategists argued in interviews that many
   suburban voters and independents increasingly see this election as a
   referendum on their family’s economic and physical security, two
   powerful motivators for female voters who have otherwise turned away
   from the GOP in recent years.

   “Suburban districts are at the core of the House battleground,” said
   Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which
   provides non-partisan analysis of campaigns. “Republicans are primed to
   make gains in the suburbs. Voters that opposed Trump or were turned off
   by Trump are now looking at the current state of the country and the
   current state of the economy and they don’t like what they see. But
   they do see Democrats in charge.”

   Though many different factors have driven up inflation and gas prices,
   it’s the party in power that often gets the blame. “Democrats are being
   held responsible for the vast majority of the problems that the country
   is facing, because they’re in control,” he said.

GOP looks to win over voters with crime messaging

   Among the 18 congressional districts that Inside Elections rates as
   toss-ups, Gonzales noted that at least nine have significant suburban
   populations, including Colorado’s 8th, Minnesota’s 2nd, Nebraska’s 2nd,
   New Jersey’s 7th, Oregon’s 5th and 6th, Pennsylvania’s 7th, Virginia’s
   2nd and Washington’s 8th. There are many other key suburban districts
   in seats that are currently tilting toward one of the parties.

   In many of them, Republicans have run countless ads trying to tie
   Democratic candidates to the calls by some progressive groups to defund
   the police following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a police
   officer. Even though most Democratic elected officials did not support
   that message – and have often echoed President Joe Biden’s calls in his
   State of the Union address to “fund the police” – the GOP has continued
   to raise the slogan as a boogeyman, linking it with the uptick in crime
   in some parts of the country. A Gallup poll from earlier this year
   found 72% of Americans were dissatisfied with the current policies to
   reduce or control crime.

   Fact check: The GOP's dishonesty-filled barrage of 'defund the police'
   attack ads

   The messages on crime could have particular salience in districts like
   Oregon 5th and 6th Districts, which include suburbs around Portland, a
   city where some of the protests after Floyd’s death turned violent.

   An ad from Congressional Leadership Fund, the Republican super PAC tied
   to House GOP leadership, targeting progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner,
   for example, shows images of rioting and burning buildings juxtaposed
   against recent headlines about the increase in violent crime in
   Portland, suggesting that McLeod-Skinner would stand with “defund the
   police radicals.”

   McLeod-Skinner, who defeated moderate Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in
   the primary and is now facing Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the
   former mayor of Happy Valley, tweeted that she is “the only candidate
   in this race with a consistent record of funding the police.”

   In Oregon’s 6th District, which also includes parts of suburban
   Portland, an ad attacking Democratic state legislator Andrea Salinas
   from the National Republican Congressional Committee and GOP opponent
   Mike Erickson states that Salinas “voted numerous times to defund the
   police,” but none of the bills cited in the ad defunded the police.
   Salinas told the Salem Statesman Journal the accusation was “patently
   false.”

   In Nevada, the messages blaming Democrats for crime and economic
   struggles are being echoed in the barrage of ads for races up and down
   the ticket – from the US Senate race where former state Attorney
   General Adam Laxalt is challenging Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez
   Masto, to the governor’s race where Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo
   is trying to unseat Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, to the three House
   seats that the GOP hopes to flip.

   Republican April Becker, who is challenging Lee in the 3rd District,
   has highlighted her own early journey as a single mom who worked as a
   waitress and a bartender. Becker, who became a lawyer at 39, argued in
   one of her ads that she’s now able to “help people who are struggling
   just like I was.” In another ad – attacking Lee while standing in front
   of a gas pump – Becker says of members of Congress: “They just don’t
   care about us.”

   Democrats, in turn, have focused on Becker’s position on abortion. One
   ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee falsely stated
   that Becker would join Republicans “trying to ban abortion nationwide,
   including Nevada” even though Becker has explicitly stated that she
   would not vote for a nationwide ban, because she believes it “would be
   unconstitutional.”

   Super PACs get less favorable advertising rates than candidates. But
   when it comes to outside spending, the Congressional Leadership Fund
   has been able to outspend the Democrats’ House Majority PAC – $168.3
   million to $124.7 million, including future reservations, as of
   Thursday. HMP has spent more on advertising about abortion than any
   other issue, while CLF has focused on taxes, inflation and crime, as
   well as unflattering depictions of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and
   Biden.

   Both super PACs have spent more in Nevada’s 3rd District in the
   expensive Las Vegas media market than any other race – about $9.8
   million by CLF and nearly $4.8 by HMP, according to an analysis of
   AdImpact data from January 2021 through Election Day, which includes
   future ad reservations. Among the ads that HMP spent the most to air
   since Labor Day weekend was one focused on abortion – targeting Becker
   as “a dangerous threat to the women of Nevada.”

   Meanwhile, Broussard said she doesn’t understand the Democratic focus
   on abortion. She favors abortion rights and disagrees with the extreme
   bans that have been put in place in some red states. But she noted that
   voters in Nevada protected abortion rights with a 1990 referendum.

   “All their talk is about abortion – who’s fighting for it or not – they
   can fight all they want. It’s us people that have to vote on that,” she
   said. This election, she added, “it’s all about the economy. The
   working class – we want to know what’s going to happen to us.”

High sticker prices drown out Democratic legislative accomplishments

   Nevada Democrats are increasingly pushing back on the economic
   messaging from the GOP by noting that Republicans have put forward very
   few specifics about what they would do to bring down costs for average
   families.

   Lee, along with Nevada’s two other vulnerable House Democrats, Dina
   Titus in the 1st District and Steven Horsford in the 4th District, have
   also amplified the message that Republicans’ vows to reduce spending
   and debt – if they win the majority – could endanger Social Security
   and Medicare.

   Lee argued that it “hasn’t been a challenge at all” to get the word out
   about how Democrats’ legislative accomplishments could change the lives
   of voters. She noted that many seniors are relieved that the recently
   passed package will allow Medicare to negotiate the price of certain
   prescription drugs, in addition to lowering other health care costs.

   Here's how Republicans would address inflation

   “This is money in people’s pockets,” Lee said after a recent event
   focused on Social Security and Medicare. “We hear over and over again
   stories of seniors who go without life-saving medications, seniors who
   are cutting their pills in half because they can’t afford it. This
   legislation not only saves money, but it will save lives.”

   But in interviews with voters here, most expressed frustration rather
   than gratitude for the Democrats’ legislative endeavors in Washington.

   Many of them lacked a basic grasp of what was included in the
   Democrats’ much-touted health care, tax and climate bill. They pointed
   instead to the myriad ways in which they have had to adjust to the
   bruising effects of inflation.

   One voter who declined to give her name noted that she can no longer
   buy flowers to brighten her home. Another, incensed, held up a
   two-pound block of Colby cheddar cheese that she said had doubled in
   price since her last visit to Smith’s grocery store in Summerlin.

   Those kinds of frustrations have led Stephanie Brambila, a 38 year-old
   voter, to give Republican candidates a second look this year.
   “Everything’s gone up instead of down. And I think it’s going to get
   worse,” she said outside a Costco west of Las Vegas.

   “I didn’t care for Trump, but Trump was better for the economy,”
   Brambila said, pointing to some of Trump’s racially charged rhetoric
   about Mexicans and immigrants. “But we voted for Biden and then
   regretted it, because he didn’t do better.”

   Jackie Zavala, an independent 48-year-old business owner, said she
   doesn’t like some of Biden’s decisions. “It’s crazy to be involved in
   all these other countries,” she said, pointing to the aid the US has
   sent to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. “It’s not our business.
   Why do they spend the money (when) we need the money here?”

   Still, she said she is likely to stick with Democrats this year,
   because she thinks they are trying to make things better.

   Kathy Beehn, a 77-year-old Democrat, said she hopes that voters
   understand that that there are other factors driving inflation –
   pointing to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. She said it
   is unfair that Biden and the Democrats are being blamed.

   At the same time, she described Biden as “a very relaxed president.”

   “I wish he had a little more pep in his step. But I think he’s trying.
   We were in pretty bad shape to start with.”
