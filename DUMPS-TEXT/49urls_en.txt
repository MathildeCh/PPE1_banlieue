   Advocates working to deconstruct police brutality and anti-Black racism
   have long called to defund the police, and in the wake of the murders
   of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, David McAtee and many
   other Black people by police, the concept has become a rallying cry
   among protestors. Activists and community organizations define
   defunding the police as moving public funds away from policing and
   incarceration, and investing instead in community resources.

   After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek
   Chauvin, organizations Black Visions and Reclaim the Block—which have
   long worked to defund the Minneapolis Police Department—launched a
   petition to the Minneapolis City Council. The petition called on
   council members to commit to four key aspects of defunding the police:

   1. To never again vote to increase police funding or to increase the
   police department's budget.

   2. To propose and vote for a $45 million cut from MPD's budget as the
   City responds to projected COVID-19 shortfalls.

   3. To protect and expand current investment in community-led health and
   safety strategies, instead of investing in police.

   4. To do everything in my power to compel MPD and all law enforcement
   agencies to immediately cease enacting violence on community members.”

   The Guardian reports that at a subsequent community rally, the council
   "pledged to disband the city’s police department and replace it with a
   new system of public safety.”

   The Movement for Black Lives defines their "Invest-Divest" platform
   (opens in new tab) thus: "We demand investments in the education,
   health and safety of Black people, instead of investments in the
   criminalizing, caging, and harming of Black people. We want investments
   in Black communities, determined by Black communities, and divestment
   from exploitative forces including prisons, fossil fuels, police,
   surveillance and exploitative corporations." (Donate to Movement for
   Black Lives here. (opens in new tab))

   Black Lives Matter, which launched a petition to #DefundThePolice
   (opens in new tab), explained, "George Floyd’s violent death was a
   breaking point—an all too familiar reminder that, for Black people, law
   enforcement doesn’t protect or save our lives. They often threaten and
   take them." The petition reads, "We call for a national defunding of
   police. We demand investment in our communities and the resources to
   ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive."

     .@AOC's answer to "what does defund the police look like?" was "a
     suburb" and that is totally gonna be my answer from now on

   Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the proponents of the
   call to defund the police, and a recent post on her Instagram story on
   the subject quickly went viral, after it was screenshotted and shared
   by Twitter user Ashley Quan. Asked, "What does an America with defunded
   police look like to you?" Ocasio-Cortez responded, "It looks like a
   suburb."

   "Affluent white communities already live in a world where the choose to
   fund youth, health, housing etc more than they fund police,"
   Ocasio-Cortez explained. "When a teenager or preteen does something
   harmful in a suburb (I say teen bc this is often where lifelong
   carceral cycles begin for Black and Brown communities), White
   communities bend over backwards to find alternatives to incarceration
   for their loved ones to 'protect their future,' like community service
   or rehab or restorative measures. Why don't we treat Black and Brown
   people the same way?

   "Why doesn't the criminal system care about Black teens' futures the
   way they care for White teens' futures?" AOC continued. "Why doesn't
   the news use Black people's graduation or family photos in stories the
   way they do when they cover White people (eg Brock Turner) who commit
   harmful crimes?"

Read Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's full response to the question,
"What does an America with defunded police look like to you?" below:

   The good news is that it actually doesn't take a ton of imagination.

   It looks like a suburb. Affluent white communities already live in a
   world where the choose to fund youth, health, housing etc more than
   they fund police. These communities have lower crime rates not because
   they have more police, but bc they have more resources to support
   healthy society in a way that reduces crime.

   When a teenager or preteen does something harmful in a suburb (I say
   teen bc this is often where lifelong carceral cycles begin for Black
   and Brown communities), White communities bend over backwards to find
   alternatives to incarceration for their loved ones to "protect their
   future," like community service or rehab or restorative measures. Why
   don't we treat Black and Brown people the same way? Why doesn't the
   criminal system care about Black teens' futures the way they care for
   White teens' futures? Why doesn't the news use Black people's
   graduation or family photos in stories the way they do when they cover
   White people (eg Brock Turner) who commit harmful crimes? Affluent
   White suburbs also design their own lives so that they walk through the
   world without having much interruption or interaction with police at
   all aside from community events and speeding tickets (and many of these
   communities try to reduce those, too!)

   Just starting THERE would be a dramatically and radically different
   world than what we are experiencing now.
