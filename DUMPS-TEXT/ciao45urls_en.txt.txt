   French authorities have detained three people and opened a terrorism
   investigation after a man attacked and killed a police administrator
   Friday with a knife at a police station in a Paris suburb.

   Security officials said the attacker stabbed a female police
   administrative worker outside the police station in the southwest Paris
   suburb of Rambouillet.

   The officials said at least one police officer at the scene opened fire
   on the assailant — identified as a 36-year-old Tunisian national living
   in France — and fatally shot him. Media reporters said the man had no
   previous criminal record and was unknown to police.

   Authorities say the victim was a 49-year-old female police
   administrator, who was returning to work after her lunch break, when
   she was attacked and stabbed in the throat. Witnesses say the attacker
   shouted “Allah Akbar” — “God is great” — as he stabbed her.

   French Prime Minister Jean Castex, along with other officials, was at
   the scene of the crime in Rambouillet, an upscale suburb about 60
   kilometers southwest of Paris in France’s Yvelines department. Castex,
   and France's antiterror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard, who also was
   at the scene, said the incident would be investigated as a terrorist
   attack.

   On his Twitter account, French President Emmanuel Macron said the
   nation is at the side of the slain police administrator, her family,
   colleagues and the police. “In the fight against Islamist terrorism, we
   will not give up.”

   The attack comes six months after another knife attack in the region
   when an Islamist teenager beheaded a schoolteacher in Conflans, another
   town outside Paris.
   France has suffered a wave of attacks by Islamist militants or
   Islamist-inspired individuals in recent years that have killed about
   250 people.
