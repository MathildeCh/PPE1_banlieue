Many U.S. states barely use red flag laws as shootings and gun deaths soar

   Chicago is one of the nation’s gun violence hotspots and a seemingly
   ideal place to employ Illinois’ “red flag” law that allows police to
   step in and take firearms away from people who threaten to kill. But
   amid more than 8,500 shootings resulting in 1,800 deaths since 2020,
   the law was used there only four times.

   It’s a pattern that’s played out in New Mexico, with nearly 600 gun
   homicides during that period and a mere eight uses of its red flag law.
   And in Massachusetts, with nearly 300 shooting homicides and just 12
   uses of its law.

   An Associated Press analysis found many U.S. states barely use the red
   flag laws touted as the most powerful tool to stop gun violence before
   it happens, a trend blamed on a lack of awareness of the laws and
   resistance by some authorities to enforce them even as shootings and
   gun deaths soar.

   AP found such laws in 19 states and the District of Columbia were used
   to remove firearms from people 15,049 times since 2020, fewer than 10
   per 100,000 adult residents. Experts called that woefully low and not
   nearly enough to make a dent in gun violence, considering the millions
   of firearms in circulation and countless potential warning signs law
   enforcement officers encounter from gun owners every day.

   California

California enacts sweeping gun control laws, setting up a legal showdown

   Newsom signs several new gun restrictions into law, just weeks after
   the Supreme Court bolstered the rights of firearms owners.

   “It’s too small a pebble to make a ripple,” Duke University sociologist
   Jeffrey Swanson, who has studied red flag gun surrender orders across
   the nation, said of the AP tally. “It’s as if the law doesn’t exist.”

   “The number of people we are catching with red flags is likely
   infinitesimal,” added Indiana University law professor Jody Madeira,
   who like other experts who reviewed AP’s findings wouldn’t speculate
   how many red flag removal orders would be necessary to make a
   difference.

   The search for solutions comes amid a string of mass shootings in
   Buffalo, N.Y.; Uvalde, Texas; and Highland Park, Ill., and a spike in
   gun violence not seen in decades: 27,000 deaths so far this year,
   following 45,000 deaths each of the past two years.

   AP’s count, compiled from inquiries and Freedom of Information Law
   requests, showed wide disparities in how the laws were applied from
   state to state, county to county, most without regard to population or
   crime rates.

   Florida led with 5,800 such orders, or 34 per 100,000 adult residents,
   but that is due mostly to aggressive enforcement in a few counties that
   don’t include Miami-Dade and others with more gun killings. More than a
   quarter of Illinois’ slim 154 orders came from one suburban county that
   makes up just 7% of the state’s population. California had 3,197 orders
   but was working through a backlog of three times that number of people
   barred from owning guns under a variety of measures who had not yet
   surrendered them.

   And a national movement among politicians and sheriffs that has
   declared nearly 2,000 counties as “Second Amendment Sanctuaries,”
   opposing laws that infringe on gun rights, may have affected red flag
   enforcement in several states. In Colorado, 37 counties that consider
   themselves “sanctuaries” issued just 45 surrender orders in the two
   years through last year, a fifth less than non-sanctuary counties did
   per resident. New Mexico and Nevada reported only about 20 orders
   combined.

   “The law shouldn’t even be there in the first place,” argued Richard
   Mack, a former Arizona sheriff who heads the pro-gun Constitutional
   Sheriffs and Peace Officers Assn. “You’re taking away someone’s
   property and means of self-defense.”

   Red flag laws, most of which came into effect over the last four years,
   allow police officers who believe gun owners are an imminent danger to
   themselves or others to petition a judge to order firearms surrendered
   or, barring that, seized for an “emergency” period, typically two
   weeks. The judge can then convene a court hearing in which petitioners
   present evidence to withhold weapons longer, typically a year, and the
   owner can argue against that.

   Politics

Why a California Democrat’s ‘red flag’ gun proposal might become law

   A red-flag provision within the House legislation that passed Thursday
   stands out as perhaps the only piece that could pass the Senate.

   AP’s tally counts an emergency order that is followed by a longer one
   as a single order if they involve the same gun owner. In rare cases
   where no one asked for an emergency order and only a longer one was
   requested and granted, that also counts as a single order. Several
   states reported incomplete data.

   Some states also allow family members of gun owners, school officials,
   work colleagues or doctors to ask for gun removal orders, also known as
   extreme risk protection orders. But data reviewed by the AP show nearly
   all petitions in several states were initiated by police, possibly
   because, as several surveys have shown, few people outside law
   enforcement are even aware the laws exist.

   The recent spike in shootings has brought renewed attention to red flag
   laws, with states including Alaska, Pennsylvania and Kentucky
   introducing legislation to add them. The Biden administration is
   seeking to foster wider use of red flag laws by allocating money in a
   newly passed federal gun law to help spread the word about such
   measures.

   An AP-NORC poll in late July found 78% of U.S. adults strongly or
   somewhat favor red flag laws, but the backlash against them has been
   intense in some states, particularly in rural areas. Opponents argue
   that allowing judges to rule on gun seizures in initial emergency
   petitions before full hearings violates due process rights, though
   court cases claiming this have generally found the laws constitutional.

Biden signs landmark bipartisan gun measure, says ‘lives will be saved’

   The law will toughen background checks for the youngest gun buyers,
   keep firearms from more domestic violence offenders and help put in
   place red flag laws.

   Many police believe seizing guns can also be dangerous and unnecessary,
   even as a last resort, especially in sparsely populated areas where
   they know many of the residents with mental health issues, said Tony
   Mace, head of the New Mexico Sheriffs’ Assn., which lobbied against the
   state’s law.

   “You’re showing up with 10 to 15 law enforcement officers and coming in
   the middle of the night and kicking in the door, and it’s already a
   dangerous environment,” said Mace, sheriff of Cibola County, a
   sanctuary county with just one order since 2020. “You’re dealing with
   someone in crisis and elevating it even more.”

   One fierce gun rights defender who still aggressively uses the law is
   Polk County, Fla., Sheriff Grady Judd, who says he doesn’t let his
   beliefs stand in the way of moving fast when gun owners threaten
   violence.

   “We’re not going to wait for an Uvalde, Texas, or a Parkland or a
   Columbine if we have the information and people say that they’re going
   to shoot or kill,” said Judd, who enforced 752 orders since 2020 in a
   county of 725,000 residents, a tally that’s more than the total orders
   for 15 entire states. “We’re going to use the tools that the state gave
   us.”

   Florida’s traditionally pro-gun Republican-led legislature passed its
   red flag law in 2018 following revelations police failed to act on
   repeated threats by an expelled student who would go on to carry out
   the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland
   earlier that year that left 17 people dead.

   A recent high-profile example of a red flag law not being used was for
   the 21-year-old gunman accused of fatally shooting seven people and
   injuring dozens more at a Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb
   of Highland Park. Robert E. Crimo III drew police attention three years
   earlier when he threatened to “kill everyone” in his house and officers
   acknowledged going to the home several times previously because of a
   “history of attempts” to take his own life.

How July 4 parade shooting suspect slipped through system

   Illinois’ ‘red-flag’ law could have stopped the suspect in the July 4
   parade shooting from buying a gun or at least delayed the purchase of a
   weapon.

   But Highland Park police never requested a gun surrender order, saying
   there was no gun belonging to Crimo to take away at the time, even
   though the law has a provision to block threatening people from making
   future purchases too.

   Illinois state Rep. Denyse Stoneback said there has clearly been a
   problem with awareness of the law among those tasked with carrying it
   out. “We’d go to police departments and they didn’t know anything about
   it,” said the Democrat who helped push through a bill last year
   providing $1 million in police red flag law training.

   Asked why Chicago had so few red flag firearm restraining orders,
   police spokesman Thomas Ahern said many of the city’s gun killings are
   committed with illegally owned firearms.

   shootings that unfolded in major cities and smaller towns across the
   U.S. But behind the stand-out headlines about shooting rampages in
   Bend, Ore., Phoenix, Detroit and Houston were dozens of murders and
   violent crimes that went largely unnoticed. (Megan Mendoza/The Arizona

‘Devastating’: Mass shootings obscure the daily U.S. gun toll

   Four high-profile shootings in U.S. cities this week drew headlines but
   masked the daily toll of gun violence in some of the same communities.

   But Ahern emphasized it remained a priority of the department to
   increase its awareness and use of the red flag law. “If we are able to
   prevent one citizen from getting hurt or killed that’s a law worth
   having and definitely not a low priority,” he said.

   In New York, a red flag-type situation that wasn’t covered under the
   state’s law nonetheless led to a spike in red flag gun surrender
   orders.

   Payton Gendron was a 17-year-old high school senior last year when he
   was investigated by New York’s State Police and ordered hospitalized
   for a mental health evaluation for typing into an economics class
   online program that his future plans included “murder-suicide.” But
   since he was a minor, he wasn’t covered under the state’s red flag law
   and it didn’t prevent him from later buying the high-powered rifle
   authorities say he used to kill 10 Black people in a racially motivated
   shooting at Buffalo supermarket in May.

   Since then, New York has seen 779 gun surrender orders under its red
   flag law, equal to nearly half of all its orders since the measure took
   effect three years ago.

   Several experts said it’s impossible to come up with an ideal number of
   red flag orders and misleading to compare states by orders because of
   the widely varying rates of gun ownership and gun homicides and
   suicides, among other stats.

   Another complicating factor is that some states have stricter gun
   ownerships rules and multiple ways to seize firearms. In California,
   for instance, guns can be taken away through domestic violence
   restraining orders, civil harassment protection orders and school
   violence prevention orders in addition to the red flag law.

   Still, experts consulted by AP agreed more could be done to enforce red
   flag laws given the prevalence of guns and the millions of gun owners
   that national studies suggest could be dangerous to themselves and
   others. In red flag states alone, figures compiled by the Gun Violence
   Archive show at least 21,100 homicides and 47,000 injuries during the
   2½ years covered by AP’s count.

   Several studies suggest red flag laws can be particularly effective in
   preventing gun suicides, which kill about 20,000 people a year. A Duke
   University study of Connecticut’s first-in-the-nation red flag law in
   1999 estimated that for every 10 to 20 surrender orders a life from a
   potential suicide was saved. A study of Indiana’s law came up with a
   similar ratio.

   While the impact of red flag laws on homicides is less well researched,
   studies suggest many mass shootings could be avoided if the laws were
   implemented aggressively. A study by the gun-control advocacy group
   Everytown for Gun Safety showed perpetrators exhibited dangerous
   warning signs before more than half of the mass shootings in the dozen
   years through 2020 that accounted for 596 deaths.

   Such warning signs have led to many opportunities to stop gun violence,
   as well as missed chances.

   In Colorado in 2020, police seized 59 guns from a man who complained of
   hit men coming to get him, bragged about shooting someone and
   repeatedly threatened his ex-wife.

   In New Jersey in 2019, police took seven guns from a man threatening on
   Facebook to attack a Walmart.

   And in Washington state in 2018, police removed 12 guns from the home
   of a man who posted on social media about killing Jews in a synagogue
   and kids in a school.

   None of those threatened shootings happened.

   But in Indianapolis in 2020, failure to employ all aspects of a red
   flag law resulted in disaster. After 18-year-old Brandon Hole’s mother
   alerted police that he was threatening to commit “suicide by cop,”
   police seized his pump-action shotgun. A county prosecutor could have
   gone further under the law to argue before a judge that Hole should be
   barred from possessing or buying a gun, but that never happened.

   A few months later, Hole bought two AR-style rifles at a gun store,
   turning to his mother and saying, “They don’t have a flag on me.”
   Several months after that, he fatally shot eight employees in a FedEx
   warehouse where he had worked and injured seven more before killing
   himself.

   “I feel the state of Indiana is an accessory to murder,” a wounded
   Angela Hughley told the Indianapolis Star shortly after the shooting.

   Amber Clark, a librarian in Sacramento might still be alive today if
   police had acted on a tip that Ronald Seay was armed and dangerous.

   The gunman’s twin brother called police in 2018 warning that Seay, who
   had a history of mental illness and trouble with police, was making
   violent threats and had two semiautomatic pistols. But the police never
   went to a judge to ask for a gun surrender order or tell the sibling
   that he could do that himself.

   A few weeks later, Seay unloaded 11 bullets into Clark’s face, head and
   body at pointblank range outside the Sacramento library.

   “It is obvious to me and my family that the application of California’s
   red flag law in this case would have saved two lives — Amber’s and the
   shooter’s — and prevented immeasurable grief,” said her husband, Kelly
   Clark. “My wife would still be alive and the killer would have received
   the help he needed instead of being condemned to life in prison.”
