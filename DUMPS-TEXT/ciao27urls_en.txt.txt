Police: Parade shooting suspect contemplated 2nd shooting

   HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) — The man charged with killing seven people at
   an Independence Day parade confessed to police that he unleashed a hail
   of bullets from a rooftop in suburban Chicago and then fled to the
   Madison, Wisconsin, area, where he contemplated shooting up an event
   there, authorities said Wednesday.

   Robert Crimo III turned back to Illinois, where he was later arrested
   after deciding he was not prepared to pull off a shooting in Wisconsin,
   Lake County Major Crime Task Force spokesman Christopher Covelli said.

   An Illinois judge ordered Crimo to be held without bail. Police found
   the shells of 83 bullets and three ammunition magazines on the rooftop
   that he fired from, Lake County Assistant State’s Attorney Ben Dillon
   said in court.

   The man charged with killing seven people when he unleashed a hail of
   bullets on an Independence Day parade from a rooftop was expected in
   court Wednesday as authorities faced questions about how he was allowed
   to buy several guns, despite threatening violence.

   Robert E. Crimo III was charged with seven counts of murder Tuesday in
   the shooting that sent hundreds of marchers, parents and children
   fleeing in fear and set off an hourslong manhunt in and around Highland
   Park, an affluent Chicago suburb on the shores of Lake Michigan.
   Investigators have yet to identify a motive.

   Crimo’s attorney said he intends to enter a not guilty plea to all
   charges. Prosecutors have promised to seek dozens more.

   A rifle “similar to an AR-15″ was used to spray more than 70 rounds
   from atop a commercial building into the parade crowd, a spokesman for
   the Lake County Major Crime Task Force said.

   A seventh victim died Tuesday. More than three dozen other people were
   wounded in the attack, which Task force spokesman Christopher Covelli
   said the suspect had planned for several weeks.

   The assault happened less than three years after police went to Crimo’s
   home following a call from a family member who said he was threatening
   “to kill everyone” there. Covelli said police confiscated 16 knives, a
   dagger and a sword, but said there was no sign he had any guns at the
   time, in September 2019.

   Police in April 2019 also responded to a reported suicide attempt by
   the suspect, Covelli said.

   Crimo legally purchased the rifle used in the attack in Illinois within
   the past year, Covelli said. In all, police said, he purchased five
   firearms, which were recovered by officers at his father’s home.

   The revelation about his gun purchases is just the latest example of
   young men who were able to obtain guns and carry out massacres in
   recent months despite glaring warning signs about their mental health
   and inclination to violence.

   Illinois state police, who issue gun owners’ licenses, said Crimo
   applied for a license in December 2019, when he was 19. His father
   sponsored his application.

   At the time “there was insufficient basis to establish a clear and
   present danger” and deny the application, state police said in a
   statement.

   Investigators who have interrogated the suspect and reviewed his social
   media posts have not determined a motive or found any indication that
   he targeted victims by race, religion or other protected status,
   Covelli said.

   At the July 4 parade, the shots were initially mistaken for fireworks
   before hundreds of revelers fled in terror. A day later, baby
   strollers, lawn chairs and other items left behind by panicked parade
   goers remained inside a wide police perimeter. Outside the police tape,
   some residents drove up to collect blankets and chairs they abandoned.

   David Shapiro, 47, said the gunfire quickly turned the parade into
   “chaos.”

   “People didn’t know right away where the gunfire was coming from,
   whether the gunman was in front or behind you chasing you,” he said
   Tuesday as he retrieved a stroller and lawn chairs.

   The shooting occurred at a spot on the parade route where many
   residents had staked out prime viewing points early in the day.

   Among them was Nicolas Toledo, who was visiting his family in Illinois
   from Mexico, and Jacki Sundheim, a lifelong congregant and staff member
   at nearby North Shore Congregation Israel.

   Nine people, ranging from 14 to 70, remained hospitalized Tuesday,
   hospital officials said.

   The shooting was just the latest to shatter the rituals of American
   life. Schools, churches, grocery stores and now community parades have
   all become killing grounds in recent months. This time, the bloodshed
   came as the nation tried to celebrate its founding and the bonds that
   still hold it together.

   The gunman initially evaded capture by dressing as a woman and blending
   into the fleeing crowd, Covelli said.

   A police officer pulled over 21-year-old Crimo north of the shooting
   scene several hours after police released his photo and warned that he
   was likely armed and dangerous, Highland Park Police Chief Lou Jogmen
   said.

   Asked about his client’s emotional state, prominent Chicago-based
   lawyer Thomas A. Durkin said he has spoken to Crimo only once — for 10
   minutes by phone. He declined to comment further.

   In 2013, Highland Park officials approved a ban on semi-automatic
   weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. A local doctor and the
   Illinois State Rifle Association quickly challenged the liberal
   suburb’s stance. The legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court’s
   doorstep in 2015 when justices declined to hear the case and let the
   suburb’s restrictions remain in place.

   Under Illinois law, gun purchases can be denied to people convicted of
   felonies, addicted to narcotics or those deemed capable of harming
   themselves or others. That last provision might have stopped a suicidal
   Crimo from getting a weapon.

   But under the law, who that provision applies to must be decided by “a
   court, board, commission or other legal authority.”

   The state has a so-called red flag law designed to stop dangerous
   people before they kill, but it requires family members, relatives,
   roommates or police to ask a judge to order guns seized.

   Crimo, who goes by the name Bobby, was an aspiring rapper with the
   stage name Awake the Rapper, posting on social media dozens videos and
   songs, some ominous and violent.

   Federal agents were reviewing Crimo’s online profiles, and a
   preliminary examination of his internet history indicated that he had
   researched mass killings and had downloaded multiple photos depicting
   violent acts, including a beheading, a law enforcement official said.

   The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly
   and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

   Shapiro, the Highland Park resident who fled the parade with his
   family, said his 4-year-old son woke up screaming later that night.

   “He is too young to understand what happened,” Shapiro said. “But he
   knows something bad happened.”
