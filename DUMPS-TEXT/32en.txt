   overland park incident action plan

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. — After the mass shooting that killed seven people in
   an Illinois suburb, KSHB 41 News spoke with police departments in the
   Kansas City area about their safety plans for larger gatherings.

   John Lacy, the public information officer for the Overland Park Police
   Department, couldn't get into detail about what's in an Incident Action
   Plan.

   However, Lacy says for every 5K or fireworks display, they always have
   one ready days in advance.

   "They always change. We may see an incident like Highland Park and
   we're going to look at that incident, find out what did they do good,
   what did they do bad, how can we improve safety here in Overland Park
   for our citizens," Lacy said.

   Like Highland Park, Illinois, where a shooter hiding on a rooftop shot
   into a 4th of July parade, Overland Park is a suburb.

   Overland Park police were on high alert Monday at the annual Corporate
   Woods fireworks display and had extra resources.

   "There were officers that stepped up and said, 'Hey, if you need me out
   there, I'm willing to come out there,'" Lacy said. "We also had
   officers in plainclothes that were mingling with the crowd."

   They had public works trucks blocking pedestrian areas to avoid someone
   driving through a crowd, taking notes from the 2016 incident in Nice,
   France, where a man plowed through a group of people at a Bastille Day
   celebration.

   OPPD was certainly aware of the need to have resources in high places
   like rooftops.

   "We have eyes everywhere," Lacy said.

   Lacy also stresses situational awareness. He said the police depend on
   every day people to keep their eyes open.

   If you see a post on social media and it doesn't sit right with you,
   tell someone about it, Lacy said.

   If you're at an event and you see something or someone and you get a
   bad gut feeling, don't hesitate to tell a police officer.

   Highland Park is actually more similar in size to Leawood, Kansas.

   Highland Park's population is about 30,000 and its police force is made
   up of 57 officers and 12 civilian employees.

   Leawood's population is 34,000 and its police force has 61 officers and
   22 support personnel.

   "I think what you're going to see is more use of unmanned aerial
   systems such as drones," John Hamilton, a retired Kansas City police
   officer, said.

   Hamilton is also a criminal justice associate professor emeritus at
   Park University. He says drones can be useful for smaller departments
   without a lot of resources, such as a helicopter.

   "Where you can get a drone that's well-equipped, that has a camera
   above it, that's fairly quiet, that you could use to do continual
   surveillance as well," Hamilton said.

   When a mass shooting happens, Hamilton says his mind always goes to
   what information was there before that could have prevented it.

   It's unclear what kind of surveillance Highland Park and its police
   department had at the parade, like snipers on rooftops, drones or
   helicopters.

   "So when I look at what was yesterday I look and say, I don't know how
   you would have prevented it short of maybe having intelligence
   information prior to the event," Hamilton said.

   Hamilton said 20 to 25 years ago, police weren't worried about
   high-powered weapons, like the Highland Park suspect had.

   "I think what's changed is some of the tactics that the shooters have
   begun to use and plans have begun to evolve to meet those needs,"
   Hamilton said.

   This after-action doesn't prevent the loss of life but he says
   pinpointing what they can do better next time is critical.

   The Kansas City Police Department also responded to KSHB 41 News'
   request, saying they've had the opportunity to plan for several large
   events during the last 10 years with a World Series win, a Super Bowl
   win, and many parades.

   KCPD has a Critical Incident Management plan in place that covers
   large-scale disasters and other incidents.

   "Our members train regularly in active shooter response," Officer Donna
   Drake, a spokesperson for KCPD, said. "We work with the FBI, the Fusion
   Center, as well as regional and local partners to gather and
   disseminate information regarding potential threats."

   Drake said they also work with schools, hospitals, and other private
   businesses to provide them with active shooter training.

   Interim Chief Mabin spoke about active shooter situations at the June
   28th Board of Police Commissioners meeting, following the Uvalde school
   shooting.

   Mabin said training for all officers is ongoing.
