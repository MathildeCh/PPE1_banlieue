   A body found on the driveway of a property near Darwin has been
   identified as an 18-year-old man who was a resident of the same suburb.

Key points:

     * The man was found dead outside a vacant house in Driver early on
       Saturday morning
     * He has been identified as an 18-year-old local
     * Police say the man's body showed signs of head trauma

   On Saturday, Northern Territory Police set up a crime scene in the
   Palmerston suburb of Driver, about a 20-minute drive east of Darwin,
   after being notified of the body at about 6:15am.

   In a statement that afternoon, a police spokesman said the man's death
   was being treated as suspicious.

   A crime scene was in place throughout Saturday and into Sunday, as
   detectives from the Major Crime Unit investigated.

   At a press conference on Sunday afternoon, NT Police Detective Acting
   Senior Sergeant Paul Morrissey said police had identified the man as an
   18-year-old Driver resident.

   "The male has since been identified and family notified," he said.

   "He's a resident of the suburb, but he certainly wasn't near his
   house."

   He also said an initial examination showed the man had suffered head
   trauma.

   An autopsy of the man's body was due to be conducted on Sunday
   afternoon.

   The house the man's body had been found outside of appeared to be a
   vacant property, Acting Senior Sergeant Morrissey said.

   He said police believed the man had died at the scene sometime after
   midnight.
