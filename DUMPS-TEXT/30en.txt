   ADDS THAT POLICE OFFICER HAS DIED - Police investigate the scene of a
   shooting on Tuesday, Oct. 26, 2021, at the Speedway gas station in
   Pontoon Beach., Ill. A police officer died Tuesday after being shot by

   PONTOON BEACH, Ill. (AP) — A man shot and seriously wounded a police
   officer Tuesday at a gas station in an Illinois suburb of St. Louis,
   authorities said.

   The Pontoon Beach officer was shot at around 8 a.m. at a Speedway gas
   station along Route 111 near its junction with Interstate 270 and was
   rushed to Saint Louis University Hospital, police said.

   Michael Fillback, the police chief in neighboring Edwardsville, told
   the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the officer was in “bad shape.”

   State Police Trooper Jayme Bufford told the newspaper that the Pontoon
   Beach officer had approached a car in the gas station's parking lot
   because he suspected it had been stolen, and that a man began firing on
   him.

   The suspect was taken into custody, said the State Police, who are
   investigating the shooting.

   Edwardsville police spokesman Michael Fillback told KSDK-TV that he
   didn't know the wounded officer’s condition and that police were trying
   to determine what led to the shooting.

   “We would ask the public for their prayers for the officer, his family
   and the Pontoon Beach Police Department," Fillback said.
