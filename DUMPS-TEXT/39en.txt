Former suburban Chicago police officer accused of dragging 66-year-old woman

   DIXMOOR, Illinois - Ronald Burge Jr., a former police commander in the
   Chicago suburb of Dixmoor, is scheduled to be in court on Monday for a
   hearing on aggravated battery charges after he allegedly dragged a
   66-year-old woman and slammed her into a wall.

   Cook County prosecutors said that Burge Jr., whose father is the police
   chief of Dixmoor, confronted Carla Bourgouis when she came to the
   Dixmoor police station after her grandson was arrested in January 2020.

   Burge arrested the boy’s father when he refused to hand over a
   cellphone he was using to record their conversation. Bourgouis said she
   then also began recording, Burge demanded she give him her cellphone,
   and she began to leave the station.

   Burge chased after Bourgouis, carried her back in, and "then
   purposefully slammed the victim’s face into the back hallway wall on
   three separate occasions," prosecutors said.

   Dixmoor Police Chief Ronald Burge Sr., the former commander’s father,
   defended his son’s actions.

   All charges against Bourgouis were dropped by prosecutors. Mondayʼs
   hearing for Burge is a status hearing.
