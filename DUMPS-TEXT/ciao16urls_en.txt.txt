   A well-to-do civil engineer from Sydney's eastern suburbs allegedly
   gave police a detailed account of killing his wife as they arrested
   him, a court has been told.

   Steven Hastings Barker, 74, is accused of murdering his wife Christine
   Barker at their Bronte home on Thursday night.

   Ms Barker, also 74, was found by police with critical injuries outside
   the home on Bronte Road about 6pm.

   Police and paramedics treated her, but she died a short time later in
   hospital.

   Her husband was arrested at the scene and taken to Waverley Police
   Station, where he was charged with murder.

   The property in the beachside suburb remained cordoned off the morning
   after the death, with numerous detectives and uniformed officers at the
   scene.

   Barker was refused bail by a Waverley magistrate on Friday after police
   prosecutor Sergeant Nicole McMahon said the evidence against the
   accused murderer was overwhelming.

   As forensic and crime scene evidence was analysed, the case against him
   was only likely to strengthen, she said.

   If convicted, the engineer faces life in prison.

   Barker's admissions to killing his wife were captured on the body-worn
   cameras of officers who arrived at the home, Sgt McMahon said.

   The alleged murder occurred in front of a child who had been inside the
   home, she said.

   Defence lawyer Matthew Bogunovich said his client was not an
   unacceptable risk to the community or fleeing the state.

   Barker had no criminal record, a long employment history and had only
   been overseas three times despite his considerable means, the court was
   told.

   Thursday's alleged murder occurred after an unravelling in the Barkers'
   long marriage and the accused killer did not pose a threat to the wider
   community, Mr Bogunovich said.

   Prison would likely be tough for Barker as a first-time offender, but
   on the balance of the serious charges against him and the strength of
   evidence against him, there was not enough reason to grant him release,
   magistrate Clare Farnan said.

   Barker dropped his head into his chest as his bail request was denied.

   A small group of supporters went to Waverley Local Court on Friday but
   declined to speak with media.

   Barker will appear at the court again on December 7.
