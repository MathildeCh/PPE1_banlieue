   Northern Territory Police are investigating after a man was found dead
   on the driveway of a property near Darwin on Saturday morning.

Key points:

     * The man's body was found in the driveway of a home in Driver at
       about 6:15am
     * NT Police have declared the site a crime scene and detectives from
       the Major Crime Unit are investigating
     * Detectives are calling for public information to assist with
       the investigation

   In a statement, police said they had been notified at about 6:15am
   of an "unresponsive adult man ... on the driveway of a residence near
   the intersection of Driver Avenue and Waterhouse Crescent".

   The home is in Driver, a suburb of the Darwin satellite city of
   Palmerston about a 20-minute drive from the Darwin CBD.

   "Upon police arrival, the man was declared deceased and a crime scene
   established," the statement said.

   is being treated as suspicious."

   "Police are urging anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour in
   Driver overnight, particularly if you have dash-cam footage, to make
   contact on 131 444," he said.

   "You can also make an anonymous report through Crime Stoppers on 1800
   333 000."

   Darryl Stokes, a Driver resident who lives nearby, said locals had been
   shocked to hear about the death this morning.

   "Everything was quiet on the street," he said.

   "I've just come out, checked on the neighbours … and I've just heard on
   the grapevine that someone deceased [was found] on the corner.

   "It's sad to hear, for the family and the person.

   "But otherwise, we're still trying to find out more, so we know our
   families and we [ourselves] are safe."

   He said he had not heard anything overnight that could suggest what
   might have happened.

   "It's just strange that we didn't hear anything, see anything," he
   said.

   "For the time it happened in the morning, it's very quiet normally and
   you would hear something."
