Youths clash with police in Paris suburb

   Youths clashed with police into the early hours of Monday in a Paris
   suburb after the death of a young man in a motorcycle accident, which
   some in the community blamed on the police, Le Parisien newspaper and
   residents reported.

   The trouble in Argenteuil, a suburb on the northern outskirts of Paris,
   marks the latest outbreak of disorder as France's strict lockdown rules
   to tackle the novel coronavirus have increased social tensions.

   Videos posted on social media showed teams of CRS riot police moving
   into housing estates. Some youths let off fireworks, while bins had
   been set on fire and police tear gas swirled in the air.

   Associates of the deceased accident victim, identified as Sabri Choubi,
   18, said his death was caused by a collision with a police car.

   Officials at the Paris police department did not immediately respond to
   a request for a comment.

   Clashes broke out in various council housing estates around Paris last
   month.

   France's banlieues – high-rise, low-income neighborhoods that encircle
   many of its cities – are frequently flashpoints of anger over social
   and economic inequality and allegations of heavy-handed policing.
