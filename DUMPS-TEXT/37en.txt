Car rams two police motorcyclists in Paris suburb -police

   PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - A motorist deliberately drove his car into
   two police motorcyclists on patrol in a Paris suburb on Monday, gravely
   injuring both, police unions said.

   The incident took place in Colombes in the northwestern outskirts of
   Paris.

   Video footage circulating on social media and on the website of daily
   newspaper Le Parisien showed one motorbike sandwiched between the
   crumpled bonnets of a police car and a black BMW. Debris from a second
   bike lay strewn on the road.

   "Two police motorcyclists in a serious condition after being
   deliberately hit in Colombes by an individual who also rammed a police
   car. Thoughts with our colleagues," the Synergie-Officiers union wrote
   on social media.

   Interior Minister Christophe Castaner hailed the response of officers
   who gave first aid to their comrades at the scene.

   "My thoughts go out to the two injured policemen who were committed to
   protecting us," Castaner wrote on Twitter.

   Police sources called the incident a deliberate act. Sources familiar
   with the investigation said the perpetrator targeted the officers to
   avenge events in Palestine.

   France's anti-terrorism prosecutor has so far not been called on to
   lead the investigation.

   France has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants. Police and
   soldiers have been targeted on multiple occasions in recent years.

   In October, an information technology assistant at the police
   headquarters in central Paris went on a knife rampage inside the
   building, killing four people before he was shot dead. He had converted
   to Islam a decade earlier.
