   A ‘tent city’ in an affluent Sydney suburb has been disbanded after an
   incident involving “violence and fire” over the long weekend proved to
   be the straw that broke the camel’s back.

   Two homeless men were arrested on Monday after a tent at a makeshift
   Northern Beaches camp was allegedly set ablaze.

   While the shanty settlement had been set up in the dunes of Dee Why for
   some years now, Northern Beaches Council today confirmed the camp was
   being pulled down.

   “A violent incident and fire in the dunes at Dee Why this weekend has
   left Council, with the assistance of NSW Police, with little other
   option but to disband the camp and remove the growing accumulation of
   rubbish and other materials which are posing an ongoing fire and safety
   risk,” Northern Beaches Council CEO Ray Brownlee told news.com.au.

   The chaos on Monday, which also saw a police officer allegedly kicked
   in the head, began about 4.30pm when authorities were called to a tent
   alight in the Dee Why sand dunes.

   “Police were also told a man, allegedly armed with a machete and a gas
   lighter, had been seen chasing another man towards the carpark about
   the same time,” a NSW Police spokesman said.

   Shortly after arriving on scene, officers from Northern Beaches command
   were allegedly assaulted while trying to arrest a 35-year-old man at a
   nearby service station.

   The man was pepper sprayed after allegedly kicking a police officer in
   the head.

   He was then taken to was taken to Manly Police Station where he has
   been charged with damage property by fire, use offensive weapon with
   intent to commit indictable offence, assault police, and resist, hinder
   police.

   A second man, 43, was arrested nearby and charged with one count each
   of assault police and intimidate police.

   A search of the area allegedly uncovered a machete and a butane gas
   lighter which have been taken for forensic analysis.

   The men, both Dee Why locals, were refused bail to face Manly Local
   Court on Monday.

   A local who witnessed the incident and one of the arrests described
   “black smoke” and an “explosion” as the tent was allegedly set ablaze.

   “So, I go for a walk between Dee Why Beach and the lagoon and discover
   shanty homes hidden in the bushes,” the local posted online.
   A gas canister and machete were found near when one man was arrested.

   “As I was walking back home, I could see black smoke and explosions
   from one shanty home.

   “(I) went in to have a look and was confronted by one very stirred-up
   guy, got the hell out of there and phoned the fireys.

   “Got back to the carpark to find a massive knife and torch thrower,
   called the cops. Dee Why is usually quite peaceful,” he concluded on
   the post which has since been taken down.

   Locals split over dune dwellings

   Despite the presence of homelessness in their community, locals have
   largely empathised with those sleeping rough in the sand dune ‘tent
   city’.

   Hundreds flooded a local Facebook forum to share their thoughts after
   the incident.

   While a few aired their frustrations with the alleged arson attack and
   the ‘tent city’ more broadly, the majority believed it was a symptom of
   the economic climate.

   “I really hope the community helps this poor man get back on his feet,
   clearly in a tough position,” one person wrote.

   “Poor buggers are having a hard enough life as it is without nosy
   people poking around,” wrote another.

   “They have no where else to go. They can’t afford rent and some are
   mentally incapable of working,” another wrote on a separate forum.

   A local barista, Ewan Lund, previously told the Daily Mail the
   residents of the makeshift campsite kept to themselves for the most
   part.

   “We know they’re there, but you can’t see them or the tents from the
   pathway,” he said.

   “One time we had a guy come in and ask for money, but otherwise you
   never see them.”

   Another anonymous local previously told northern beaches publication,
   the Manly Observer, the homeless were mostly unseen but there had been
   reports of issues.
   Northern Beaches Council has previously said it was not planning to
   move people on from the site.

   “Almost no one knows that they’re there unless they’ve had issues with
   them. There has been council and police going there but they can’t do
   anything and I think they prefer to have them contained there so
   they’re not causing issues anywhere else,’ the resident was reported
   saying.

   “Two ladies you see before sunrise rain or shine walk up and down Dee
   Why Beach collect every piece of rubbish. They do it out of love for
   the area.

   “Apparently they came out of the camp and threatened the two ladies to
   go away for getting too close.”

   The bush dwellings were in stark contrast to the homes of the
   multimillion suburb of Dee Why, nestled among some of the most
   expensive localities in the country – including Manly and Palm Beach.

   With a median house price of $2.8 million, Dee Why also hosts a slim
   vacancy rate at just 1.7 per cent and median rental prices of $925 per
   week for a home, $865 for a townhouse and $585 for a unit.

   The Northern Beaches Council, which is responsible for the area, has
   previously stated it was aware of the dwellings but had not considering
   moving the residents on.

   “We have been working with relevant homeless support agencies in a
   continual effort to provide assistance to those living in the dunes at
   Dee Why for a number of years now,” Mr Brownlee said.

   “Homelessness is a complex issue and we have sought to approach those
   involved with understanding and compassion.

   “Council is continuing to facilitate assistance to those impacted
   through welfare and housing agencies and communicate support options
   available to them.”

   News.com.au understand while the council has some positive outcomes
   previous residents of the camp, the current residents had repeatedly
   rejected offers of support.
