   A ‘tent city’ in an affluent Sydney suburb has been disbanded after an
   incident involving “violence and fire” over the long weekend proved to
   be the straw that broke the camel’s back.

   Two homeless men were arrested on Monday after a tent at a makeshift
   Northern Beaches camp was allegedly set ablaze.

   While the shanty settlement had been set up in the dunes of Dee Why for
   some years now, Northern Beaches Council today confirmed the camp was
   being pulled down.

   “A violent incident and fire in the dunes at Dee Why this weekend has
   left Council, with the assistance of NSW Police, with little other
   option but to disband the camp and remove the growing accumulation of
   rubbish and other materials which are posing an ongoing fire and safety
   risk,” Northern Beaches Council CEO Ray Brownlee told news.com.au.

   The chaos on Monday, which also saw a police officer allegedly kicked
   in the head, began about 4.30pm when authorities were called to a tent
   alight in the Dee Why sand dunes.

   “Police were also told a man, allegedly armed with a machete and a gas
   lighter, had been seen chasing another man towards the carpark about
   the same time,” a NSW Police spokesman said.

   Shortly after arriving on scene, officers from Northern Beaches command
   were allegedly assaulted while trying to arrest a 35-year-old man at a
   nearby service station.

   The man was pepper sprayed after allegedly kicking a police officer in
   the head.

   He was then taken to was taken to Manly Police Station where he has
   been charged with damage property by fire, use offensive weapon with
   intent to commit indictable offence, assault police, and resist, hinder
   police.

   A second man, 43, was arrested nearby and charged with one count each
   of assault police and intimidate police.

   A search of the area allegedly uncovered a machete and a butane gas
   lighter which have been taken for forensic analysis.

   The men, both Dee Why locals, were refused bail to face Manly Local
   Court on Monday.

   A local who witnessed the incident and one of the arrests described
   “black smoke” and an “explosion” as the tent was allegedly set ablaze.

   “So, I go for a walk between Dee Why Beach and the lagoon and discover
   shanty homes hidden in the bushes,” the local posted online.
   A gas canister and machete were found near when one man was arrested.

   “As I was walking back home, I could see black smoke and explosions
   from one shanty home.

   “(I) went in to have a look and was confronted by one very stirred-up
   guy, got the hell out of there and phoned the fireys.

   “Got back to the carpark to find a massive knife and torch thrower,
   called the cops. Dee Why is usually quite peaceful,” he concluded on
   the post which has since been taken down.

   Locals split over dune dwellings

   Despite the presence of homelessness in their community, locals have
   largely empathised with those sleeping rough in the sand dune ‘tent
   city’.

   Hundreds flooded a local Facebook forum to share their thoughts after
   the incident.

   While a few aired their frustrations with the alleged arson attack and
   the ‘tent city’ more broadly, the majority believed it was a symptom of
   the economic climate.

   “I really hope the community helps this poor man get back on his feet,
   clearly in a tough position,” one person wrote.

   “Poor buggers are having a hard enough life as it is without nosy
   people poking around,” wrote another.

   “They have no where else to go. They can’t afford rent and some are
   mentally incapable of working,” another wrote on a separate forum.

   A local barista, Ewan Lund, previously told the Daily Mail the
   residents of the makeshift campsite kept to themselves for the most
   part.

   “We know they’re there, but you can’t see them or the tents from the
   pathway,” he said.

   “One time we had a guy come in and ask for money, but otherwise you
   never see them.”

   Another anonymous local previously told northern beaches publication,
   the Manly Observer, the homeless were mostly unseen but there had been
   reports of issues.
   Northern Beaches Council has previously said it was not planning to
   move people on from the site.

   “Almost no one knows that they’re there unless they’ve had issues with
   them. There has been council and police going there but they can’t do
   anything and I think they prefer to have them contained there so
   they’re not causing issues anywhere else,’ the resident was reported
   saying.

   “Two ladies you see before sunrise rain or shine walk up and down Dee
   Why Beach collect every piece of rubbish. They do it out of love for
   the area.

   “Apparently they came out of the camp and threatened the two ladies to
   go away for getting too close.”

   The bush dwellings were in stark contrast to the homes of the
   multimillion suburb of Dee Why, nestled among some of the most
   expensive localities in the country – including Manly and Palm Beach.

   With a median house price of $2.8 million, Dee Why also hosts a slim
   vacancy rate at just 1.7 per cent and median rental prices of $925 per
   week for a home, $865 for a townhouse and $585 for a unit.

   The Northern Beaches Council, which is responsible for the area, has
   previously stated it was aware of the dwellings but had not considering
   moving the residents on.

   “We have been working with relevant homeless support agencies in a
   continual effort to provide assistance to those living in the dunes at
   Dee Why for a number of years now,” Mr Brownlee said.

   “Homelessness is a complex issue and we have sought to approach those
   involved with understanding and compassion.

   “Council is continuing to facilitate assistance to those impacted
   through welfare and housing agencies and communicate support options
   available to them.”

   News.com.au understand while the council has some positive outcomes
   previous residents of the camp, the current residents had repeatedly
   rejected offers of support.

   A body found on the driveway of a property near Darwin has been
   identified as an 18-year-old man who was a resident of the same suburb.

Key points:

     * The man was found dead outside a vacant house in Driver early on
       Saturday morning
     * He has been identified as an 18-year-old local
     * Police say the man's body showed signs of head trauma

   On Saturday, Northern Territory Police set up a crime scene in the
   Palmerston suburb of Driver, about a 20-minute drive east of Darwin,
   after being notified of the body at about 6:15am.

   In a statement that afternoon, a police spokesman said the man's death
   was being treated as suspicious.

   A crime scene was in place throughout Saturday and into Sunday, as
   detectives from the Major Crime Unit investigated.

   At a press conference on Sunday afternoon, NT Police Detective Acting
   Senior Sergeant Paul Morrissey said police had identified the man as an
   18-year-old Driver resident.

   "The male has since been identified and family notified," he said.

   "He's a resident of the suburb, but he certainly wasn't near his
   house."

   He also said an initial examination showed the man had suffered head
   trauma.

   An autopsy of the man's body was due to be conducted on Sunday
   afternoon.

   The house the man's body had been found outside of appeared to be a
   vacant property, Acting Senior Sergeant Morrissey said.

   He said police believed the man had died at the scene sometime after
   midnight.

   that material."

   A crime scene was still in place in Driver on Sunday.

   Auckland police have responded to a series of burglaries overnight in
   several suburbs.

   About 3am a BP station on Manukau Road in the central suburb of Epsom

   The BP station's staff members said this was the second time they had
   been targeted.

   A retail store 50km away in Pukekohe was also ram-raided.

   Police said they tried to stop the vehicle on State Highway 1, but it
   escaped.

   Police's Eagle helicopter was used to locate the car and it was spiked
   in the Manurewa area.

   Two teenagers, aged 13 and 14, have been taken into custody.

   In a separate incidents, windows of a dairy in the southern suburb of
   Takanini were smashed just after 2am.

   At 3.15am, a store on Alfred Street in central Auckland was broken into
   and goods were stolen.

   A police spokesperson said they were examining CCTV footage to see what
   had been stolen.

   Ten minutes later, at 3.40am, the windows of a New Lynn liquor store
   were smashed.

   Police said investigations were ongoing in all incidents.

   Winchmore Hill is a leafy suburb in the heart of Enfield in North
   London. It was once a small Medieval parish, thatʼs certainly still
   kept some of its historic features. Anyone visiting the area would be
   surprised to find out itʼs in London, as many residents say it feels
   like a village. The area does have its own village green, which is
   surrounded by independent shops, cafes, restaurants, and a pub.

   Many of the properties are Edwardian in character, and have an average
   price of around £700,000, according to Rightmove. But just off The
   Green is the famous and highly desirable Broad Walk, where house prices
   have sold for an average of £3,150,000. The road has often been called
   ʼmillionaires rowʼ. One of the houses was used as The X Factor house
   during the 10th series in 2013

   The suburb is around nine miles from Central London, and itʼs a popular
   choice for many commuters with excellent transport links. The
   neighbourhood has itʼs own station. It takes around 30 minutes to get
   to Moorgate on Great Northern services. Itʼs also in close reach of the
   Piccadilly line at Southgate, Arnos Grove, and Bounds Green.

   The neighbourhood was once a small Medieval hamlet in Edmonton, first
   mentioned from around 1319. Quakers were the main settlers in Winchmore
   Hill, and their 1790 meeting house is still used as a religious
   building today.

   Itʼs bordered by Grovelands Park, an expanse of green space with
   designated Grade II* listed status. Famous British architect, John
   Nash, designed the beautiful Grovelands House thatʼs located within the
   grounds of the park. Grovelands has tennis courts, bowling, fishing, a
   playground, pitches and an outdoor gym.

   The area is not only concentrated around The Green. It extends to
   Aldermans Hill in Palmers Green, and borders Edmonton. It also has some
   pretty famous residents. They reportedly include Baby Spice Emma
   Bunton, presenter and singer Myleene Klass, and singer Louise Redknapp.

   Councillors for the Winchmore Hill ward, Cllr Maria Alexandrou and Cllr
   Lee Chamberlain spoke about what makes the neighbourhood a great place
   to live in: "Winchmore Hill has transformed from a hamlet into a
   beautiful residential suburb adorned with lush greenery and mature tree
   lined streets.

   "The architectural style ranges include attractive Edwardian and
   Georgian houses with original features as well as quaint cottages and
   the imposing gothic design of St Paul’s Church. Broad Walk is the
   exquisite millionaire’s road in the area, bordering the local park.

   crown" (Image: Getty Images)

   "Grovelands Park is the jewel in Winchmore Hill’s crown. This leafy
   green suburb hosts a train station which still retains its charismatic
   timber canopy and has easy transport links to the city. The bus routes
   support travel to the local excellent schools. Winchmore Hill is one of
   the safest places and its picturesque rural setting is a welcoming
   place to reside."

   Charlie Menegatos owns Going Greek, a restaurant and takeaway business
   with one of five North London restaurants located on The Green in
   Winchmore Hill. He says the area is ʼcosyʼ and ʼfamily orientatedʼ,
   while everyone loves ʼto help one anotherʼ.

   He added: "Winchmore Hill has a very cosy/family orientated feel when
   it comes to owning a business in the area. Steps to pedestrianize The
   Green and make it a lovely al fresco dining area has also given
   Winchmore Hill a real boost."

   Havilands, an estate agents that operates in the area, said the
   Winchmore Hill property market has "always been in its own bubble" and
   buyers "come from all over London". A spokesperson continued: "During
   Covid the prices unexpectedly rose to limits we couldnʼt believe.

   "Winchmore Hill is known for its period homes from the Victorian and
   Edwardian era and there are plenty around. N21 also has some very
   premium roads, like Broad Walk, Seaforth Gardens, Branscombe Gardens
   and Eversley Crescent with its luxury detached homes that are rarely
   available for sale."

   Itʼs easy to see why Winchmore Hill was named one of the best places to
   live in the UK last year by The Times. The area has a lot to offer with
   good schools, lots to do, and great transport links. Havilands says the
   area is "the smaller version of its big brothers Crouch End and Muswell
   Hill," which are two other fashionable suburban neighbourhoods in North
   London.

Police: Suspected gunman in Philippine broadcaster’s killing surrenders,

   Police: Suspected gunman in Philippine broadcaster’s killing
   surrenders, confesses Filipino press freedom and human rights activists
   take part in a protest condemning the killing of broadcaster Percival
   Mabasa (also known as Percy Lapid), in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Oct.
   4, 2022.

   Philippine police on Tuesday announced the arrest of a suspect in the
   killing of a radio journalist who was known for criticizing President
   Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his immediate predecessor.

   The suspect, identified as Joel Estorial, 39, gave himself up to the
   Philippine National Police (PNP) and Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos
   and was charged with murder two weeks after seasoned radio broadcaster
   Percival Mabasa (also known as Percy Lapid) was gunned down in a suburb
   south of Manila, official said.

   Estorial surrendered “out of fear for personal safety following public
   disclosure of … CCTV footage revealing his face during the incident and
   naming him as [a] primary person of interest,” according to a statement
   from Abalos’ office.

   “This is a major breakthrough. He made an extra-judicial confession,
   duly assisted by counsel,” Abalos said, adding that the suspect had
   named three other accomplices who are subjects of “intensive follow-up
   operations.”

   The gun used to shoot Mabasa was recovered and “positively linked to
   the crime scene” by the police forensics laboratory, according to the
   national police.

   Estoral confessed that five others had allegedly participated in the
   planning and killing of the broadcaster, but he only managed to
   identify three.

   Mabasa, who worked for DWBL radio station, was ambushed on Oct. 3 as he
   drove his car toward a gated community in Las Pinas, a suburb in
   southern metro Manila. He was the latest in a long line of killings
   targeting members of the Philippine media.

   However, the motive for his murder remains unknown. Abalos did not
   answer reporters when they asked him about this on Tuesday.

   “Just give us a few more days. We have to get the mastermind, that’s
   very important. The investigation is ongoing right now, there are many
   more details. Let’s not jeopardize them,” he said.

   The suspect in custody was presented at the press briefing, where he
   spoke to reporters.

   Someone from inside the country’s main prison facility, whom Estoral
   did not identify, had ordered a hit on Mabasa, he said. He identified
   two brothers and a third man as fellow accomplices in the attack.

   “I was afraid and conscience-struck for the killing of Percy Lapid,”
   said a handcuffed Estorial, who wore a helmet and bullet-proof vest.

   “Our arrangement was for whoever got closest to Percy would be the one
   to fire the fatal shot, and I was in that position. I was threatened
   with death if I didn’t shoot Percy at that moment, so I did,” Estorial
   said.

   The team was paid 550,000 pesos (U.S. $9,300) for the hit, he told
   reporters.

   “I hope the family forgives me. I did not want to do it, I was just
   forced to do so,” he said.

   Mabasa’s family issued a statement Tuesday thanking the police and
   saying they hoped his killing would not become just another statistic
   among murders of Filipino journalists dating back decades.

   “We hope this development leads to the identification, arrest and
   prosecution of the mastermind,” the family said.

   The Southeast Asian nation ranks among the most dangerous countries for
   journalists worldwide. Dozens have been killed with impunity since the
   dictatorship of Marcos’ late father, Ferdinand E. Marcos, more than 36
   years ago.

   Mabasa’s commentaries were often bold and sharp as he sought to counter
   fake news spread on air as well as on social media. He had also hit out
   against a perceived attempt by supporters of the Marcos family to
   distort history and had been bitingly critical of the war on drugs by
   Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, which left thousands dead.
   During his six years in office, Duterte had said journalists were fair
   game if they were corrupt.

   The Duterte administration worked to close down broadcaster ABS-CBN
   Corp. and convict Maria Ressa, the chief executive of the news website
   Rappler who was later named a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, on
   cyber libel charges.

   Jeoffrey Maitem and Mark Navales in Cotabato City, southern
   Philippines, and Basilio Sepe in Manila contributed to this report.

   Northern Territory Police are investigating after a man was found dead
   on the driveway of a property near Darwin on Saturday morning.

Key points:

     * The man's body was found in the driveway of a home in Driver at
       about 6:15am
     * NT Police have declared the site a crime scene and detectives from
       the Major Crime Unit are investigating
     * Detectives are calling for public information to assist with
       the investigation

   In a statement, police said they had been notified at about 6:15am
   of an "unresponsive adult man ... on the driveway of a residence near
   the intersection of Driver Avenue and Waterhouse Crescent".

   The home is in Driver, a suburb of the Darwin satellite city of
   Palmerston about a 20-minute drive from the Darwin CBD.

   "Upon police arrival, the man was declared deceased and a crime scene
   established," the statement said.

   Darryl Stokes, a Driver resident who lives nearby, said locals had been
   shocked to hear about the death this morning.

   "Everything was quiet on the street," he said.

   "I've just come out, checked on the neighbours … and I've just heard on
   the grapevine that someone deceased [was found] on the corner.

   "It's sad to hear, for the family and the person.

   "But otherwise, we're still trying to find out more, so we know our
   families and we [ourselves] are safe."

   He said he had not heard anything overnight that could suggest what
   might have happened.

   "It's just strange that we didn't hear anything, see anything," he
   said.

   "For the time it happened in the morning, it's very quiet normally and
   you would hear something."

Sydney engineer 'confessed' murder to cops

   the Sydney suburb of Bronte. (Bianca De Marchi/AAP PHOTOS)

   A well-to-do civil engineer from Sydney's eastern suburbs allegedly
   gave police a detailed account of killing his wife as they arrested
   him, a court has been told.

   Steven Hastings Barker, 74, is accused of murdering his wife Christine
   Barker at their Bronte home on Thursday night.

   Ms Barker, also 74, was found by police with critical injuries outside
   the home on Bronte Road about 6pm.

   Police and paramedics treated her, but she died a short time later in
   hospital.

   Her husband was arrested at the scene and taken to Waverley Police
   Station, where he was charged with murder.

   The property in the beachside suburb remained cordoned off the morning
   after the death, with numerous detectives and uniformed officers at the
   scene.

   Barker was refused bail by a Waverley magistrate on Friday after police
   prosecutor Sergeant Nicole McMahon said the evidence against the
   accused murderer was overwhelming.

   As forensic and crime scene evidence was analysed, the case against him
   was only likely to strengthen, she said.

   If convicted, the engineer faces life in prison.

   Barker's admissions to killing his wife were captured on the body-worn
   cameras of officers who arrived at the home, Sgt McMahon said.

   The alleged murder occurred in front of a child who had been inside the
   home, she said.

   Defence lawyer Matthew Bogunovich said his client was not an
   unacceptable risk to the community or fleeing the state.

   Barker had no criminal record, a long employment history and had only
   been overseas three times despite his considerable means, the court was
   told.

   Thursday's alleged murder occurred after an unravelling in the Barkers'
   long marriage and the accused killer did not pose a threat to the wider
   community, Mr Bogunovich said.

   Prison would likely be tough for Barker as a first-time offender, but
   on the balance of the serious charges against him and the strength of
   evidence against him, there was not enough reason to grant him release,
   magistrate Clare Farnan said.

   Barker dropped his head into his chest as his bail request was denied.

   A small group of supporters went to Waverley Local Court on Friday but
   declined to speak with media.

   Barker will appear at the court again on December 7.

FBI: Michigan art dealer faked lung transplant in $1.6M art fraud scheme

   Oct. 22 (UPI) -- A Michigan art dealer was arrested earlier this month
   and charged for allegedly scamming seniors out of more than $1.6
   million in profit from selling art they owned at her gallery in the
   Detroit suburb of Birmingham.

   Wendy Halsted Beard, the owner and operator of The Wendy Halsted
   Gallery, was arrested by FBI agents on Oct. 14 and charged with wire
   fraud and mail fraud, the FBI announced in a statement Friday while
   seeking potential victims.

   Investigators said Beard had taken fine art photography on consignment
   and sold them while pocketing the profits. She has also been accused of
   selling artwork to a victim but never delivering it after receiving
   payment.

   Court documents obtained by UPI show that Beard posted a $10,000 bond
   on the day of her arrest. It was not immediately clear if she has since
   been released from custody.

   The FBI alleged in court documents that Beard, who inherited the
   gallery from her father, had carried out her scheme to defraud victims
   since 2017. Her father, Thomas Halsted, died in 2018.

   The investigation into Beard began when the Birmingham Police
   Department received multiple complaints alleging that the art dealer
   had never returned photographs at the end of the period of consignment.
   Birmingham police referred the complaints to the FBI.

   "Throughout the course of the investigation, potentially dozens of
   victims were identified, this affidavit highlights just a few of these
   victims' interactions with Beard," an FBI agent wrote in the court
   documents.

   criminal

   Artwork sold by Beard included a "mural-sized" photograph by Ansel
   Adams titled "The Tetons and the Snake River, Grand Teton National
   Park, 1942."

   It was among nearly $1 million in fine art photographs taken on
   consignment from an 82-year-old victim, identified in court documents
   as Victim 1.

   The photograph was allegedly sold for $440,000 and had previously been
   appraised with a value of $625,000 in 2016.
   RELATED Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz dies at 78

   The victim provided the FBI with emails in which Beard had said she had
   taken the print to try to sell it in Jackson, Wyoming, but was not
   successful.

   When the consignment period expired, Beard signed a consignment
   agreement with a gallery in Jackson to sell the print, which the
   gallery purchased on behalf of a private collector, the FBI said.

   Bank records show that a $440,000 interstate wire transfer was sent for
   the purchase in June 2020.

   The print changed hands a few more times before it was ultimately
   bought by a private client for $685,000 to be displayed at their
   residence in Idaho.

   "According to Victim 1, they were never notified by Beard of the sale
   of their Ansel Adams's photograph, and they subsequently never received
   any proceeds of the sale," court documents read.

   "Victim 1 made multiple attempts to have their photographs returned by
   Beard, who provided Victim 1 with excuses on why the artwork could not
   be returned. Often the excuses were pertaining to Beard's alleged poor
   pulmonary health conditions."

   Court documents show that Beard used alias email accounts purporting to
   be assistants at the gallery when she allegedly claimed to have
   undergone a double lung transplant as an excuse for not returning the
   artwork to the owner.

   "Multiple victim's reported receiving messages from these email
   accounts with statements claiming Beard was in the hospital or in a
   coma and could not be contacted directly," the FBI agent wrote in the
   court documents.

   "Based on my experience and training, I believe Beard created these and
   other fictitious assistants and email addresses in furtherance of the
   fraud and to create sympathy from her victims and justify why she had
   not returned their artwork."

   The FBI said in court documents that there is no record of Beard ever
   having been the recipient of a donated organ.

   Beard is also accused of having stolen a photograph by Ansel Adams
   after it was taken on consignment from an 89-year-old man with
   Alzheimer's disease, prosecutors said.

   That victim, identified as Victim 2, had also given Beard pictures by
   other renowned artists including Ion Zupco, Arnold Newman and Jerry
   Uelsma.

   When the victim sought to have the photographs returned, Beard dropped
   the photographs off at a local framer to be framed. When the victim's
   family received the pictures back from the framers, they noticed that
   the signed Ansel Adams photograph, titled "Tenaya Creek," was missing
   his signature.

   "Further, a second image purporting to be a signed photograph by Ansel
   Adams titled 'Siesta Lake Portfolio' was, in actuality, an altogether
   different Ansel Adams photo known as 'Moon and Half Dome,'" the court
   documents read.

   Detectives with the Birmingham Police Department interviewed Beard at
   her residence in May and she agreed to return the two Ansel Adams
   photographs to Victim 2.

   "Beard walked into another room of Beard's residence and retrieved
   three wrapped and framed photographs, insisting they were the missing
   photographs belonging to Victim 2," the court documents read.

   "The detective unwrapped the photos, determined they were still the
   incorrect pictures, and left without taking any photographs."

   Beard dropped off two photographs to Birmingham police in June, which
   were sent to the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite, California for
   authentication. The gallery said that the two pictures prints she
   provided were reproduction prints that could be purchased in its gift
   shop for $375 each.

   The FBI obtained records from Paypal that show Beard bought a
   photograph titled "Tenaya Creek, Dogwood, Rain - Unframed / No Color"
   from the Ansel Adams Gallery for $405.26.

   The FBI added that numerous other victims were interviewed by FBI
   agents as a part of the investigation.

   "During the course of this investigation, over 100 rare fine art
   photographs with a combined estimated value of approximately $1.6
   million have been identified as being consigned to Beard and not
   returned or sold to victims without being delivered," the court
   documents read.

   "Bank records and other business records indicate there are likely be
   more victims who have yet to be interviewed."

   Those who may be a victim or have additional information about
   potential fraud involving this defendant are asked to contact the FBI
   at 1-800-CALL-FBI or submit a tip online.

Denver suburb where Elijah McClain died ousts police chief

   By Associated Press
   Published: Wednesday, April 6th, 2022 at 10:45AM
   Updated: Wednesday, April 6th, 2022 at 5:01PM

   FILE - Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson addresses members of the
   media to discuss a shooting at Nome Park on Nov. 15, 2021, in Aurora,
   Colo. The Denver suburb where a Black man died after being confronted
   by police in 2019 has ousted its police chief, Wednesday, April 6,
   2022, nearly two years after she took over vowing to rebuild community
   relations and reform the department. In a press release, Aurora's city
   manager implied that while Wilson prioritized community involvement,
   she didn't effectively manage the police department. (Helen H.
   Richardson/The Denver Post via AP, File)

   DENVER — The Denver suburb where police officers and paramedics have
   been charged in the death of a Black man in 2019 ousted its
   reform-minded police chief Wednesday, faulting her management of a
   department at a time of rising crime and officer departures.

   However, lawyers for Vanessa Wilson, who became chief in Aurora in 2020
   after the death of Elijah McClain gained new attention amid protests
   over police brutality and racial injustice following the police killing
   of George Floyd, said she was the victim of a campaign to damage her
   reputation by conservative city council members who opposed reforms.

   Last year, the city signed an agreement with State Attorney General
   Phil Weiser to make changes aimed at ending a pattern of racially
   biased policing and excessive force. Before that, Wilson also acted
   quickly to discipline and fire officers accused of misconduct,
   including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock
   McClain’s death.

   “In an effort to justify getting rid of Chief Wilson, the City and
   Council have engaged in a conspiracy to leak misinformation to the
   media and falsely attribute responsibility for the department’s
   long-standing historical problems to Chief Wilson,” Wilson’s lawyers
   said.

   City Manager Jim Twombly said Wilson excelled in her community outreach
   work in Colorado’s third-largest city but he said he fired her because
   of concerns about her leadership and management of the department. He
   declined to give specific examples other than mentioning a backlog of
   thousands of crime reports, with the potential to delay investigations
   and arrests, that he said he first learned about last month, in a list
   of more general factors contributing to his decision. A report on the
   findings of a city-commissioned independent audit on the records
   backlog was issued Tuesday.

   Twombly also said he had ongoing conversations with officers in the
   department and was concerned about the number of officers who have
   left. When asked by a reporter, he said he was concerned about the rise
   in crime in the community but he did not attribute that to Wilson.

   “It really comes down to a lack of confidence on my part for her to be
   able to lead the department,” he said.

   Twombly said Aurora would continue to uphold its consent decree
   agreement with the attorney general, signed in November, but some were
   skeptical.

   “Aurora is already regressing soon after the ink has dried on the
   consent decree,” said Qusair Mohamedbhai, who represents McClain’s
   mother, Sheneen McClain, and Kyle Vinson, a Black man who was shown on
   video being pistol whipped by an Aurora police officer last year.

   The state lawmakers who represent Aurora, all Democrats, issued a
   statement saying Wilson’s firing will set back efforts to eliminate
   “the department’s longstanding pattern and practice of racist
   policing.”

   “Her firing in the middle of these efforts sends a terrible message to
   the police force and to the community about Aurora’s commitment to
   reforming these practices,” they said.

Students at Joliot-Curie high school near Paris denounce police attacks

   Last week, WSWS journalists interviewed high school students at the
   Joliot-Curie high school in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris. For the past
   two weeks, police have been attacking students at the school, with 18
   students arrested and several injured. The statements collected by WSWS
   reveal that this is a provocation by the police against youth from a
   working class suburb.

   The first protests on October 10 were peaceful, according to the
   testimonies of all the students. On the 11th, the police surrounded the
   youth in front of the school and then attacked them with tear gas, tear
   gas grenades, and batons and arrested fourteen of them. On the 18th,
   another confrontation resulted in four arrests. When WSWS spoke to the
   students, one student was still in the hospital.

   One student, Sara, explained why the students blocked the school:
   'First, students protested against the cancelling of a homework help
   program which helped a lot (but) was taken away, and they protested for
   the right to wear clothes that were banned as religious when they are
   not religious.'

   According to Awa, 'The blockades were peaceful, there was no violence.
   The only thing the students did was put padlocks on the door.'

   Sophiane, age 15, had his arm in a sling after being thrown to the
   ground by the police. He said, 'the police started charging at us. They
   came, they started gassing us, they dislocated my shoulder. Now I'll be
   in a splint for at least a month and a half. It is very complicated for
   me. My family is suffering. There are people, they are traumatized in
   my class with everything that happened and it's hard for our future.'

   Sara confirmed that the police started the violence: 'They started
   throwing tear gas canisters at us, attacking us'

   Awa testified that the police gassed the high school students, some of
   whom were hit by the tear gas canisters: 'The gas stings your throat,
   that, like your eyes. You feel your eyes tear up when you're right next
   to the gas. Your eyes are all red. You have a hard time breathing all
   around.'

   Awa said police threw stun grenades at the high school students. She
   also saw police arrest a 15-year-old high school student and several
   veiled high school girls.

   Another student, Noya, said the police violence on October 11 was a
   provocation prepared by a squad of more than 50 cops who arrived at the
   school early in the morning: 'They came with shin guards, they had
   helmets, they had batons, they had guns, they had flash balls ... they
   had the whole thing.' Awa added that the high school students, on the
   other hand, had nothing.

   Noya emphasized the impact of the violence on the high school students:
   'All the students who were put in a lecture hall, a big room. There
   were some who were in a bad way. They cried and they fainted because of
   the shock of what had happened to them.'

   The police crackdown was so broad that it even affected passers-by in
   the neighborhood, Awa said: 'You go by where there are kids, there are
   little ones who were gassed. There was a grandmother who was running
   because they practically started gassing her.'

   According to Awa, 'They searched almost every person they found
   quote-unquote suspicious, that is, blacks and Arabs. Nobody was armed,
   nobody had anything.' She then recounted the accounts she had heard of
   police violence against the detained high school students, 'I was told
   that they were not fed. I had been hit, it was nonsense. Why do the
   police hit so hard? Minors? They are hitting people who are not even
   fifteen years old.'

   According to Awa and Noya, since the police assault, numerous police
   buses have surrounded the school every morning at 7 a.m. to keep an eye
   on students entering the establishment.

   Students told WSWS that despite the brutal violence directed at the
   students, the school's administration defends the police action. After
   the assault, injured and traumatized students were forced to continue
   with classes as if nothing had occurred.

   Despite the police repression, students at Joliot-Curie also joined the
   wave of blockades and demonstrations on October 18, in solidarity with
   the interprofessional strike that day. One high school student
   expressed his opposition to the requisitioning of strikers at the
   refineries: 'We're just trying to show that we're against it, to show
   that we can demand our social rights.'

   Asked about the reasons for the police assault on Joliot-Curie, Awa
   said that the high school students 'wanted to be listened to, they made
   a blockade, and they are young people from the suburbs. The police, as
   a result, are going to say to themselves 'no, they are dangerous,'
   immediately, because in France, we have a problem: people who come from
   the suburbs are automatically type-cast as criminals, as violent
   people, when this is not at all the case. If you took the time to be in
   Nanterre, you would see there is a spirit of solidarity between blacks,
   Arabs, and whites.'

   The students also explained that the government's reactionary campaign
   against 'Islamism' in French schools served to repress them.

   Awa said, 'I saw a lot of people in dresses, they weren't Muslims. It's
   a fabric, it's a garment. It doesn't mean anything. It's silly, in many
   different cultures you see long dresses, whether it's in India, in
   Africa, or anywhere. So it's not because someone puts on a long dress
   that they're necessarily Muslim ... we aren’t trying to Islamize the
   high school.'

   She added, 'This is a secular high school. How, technically, could
   students Islamize a high school? It's not possible.”

   Awa and Noya added that on several occasions, high school girls whose
   dresses were considered too long or too loose had been forced to remove
   them. According to Sofiane, even baggy t-shirts were considered
   'religious signs' by the school administration and therefore banned.

   While interviewing students, WSWS reporters witnessed dozens of
   students leaving the school and putting back on headwear and
   loose-fitting dresses that were banned in class. This widely hated
   rule, which helped spark the protests at Joliot-Curie, is however the
   law in France.

   The students testified to the official brutality that prevails in
   France as the ruling elite is ever more terrified of rising social
   anger. Ava explained, 'In France, I say, it works like a dictatorship.
   Your superiors are all there and literally tell you what to do and you
   have no say. You have no right to speak and the only way to make
   yourself heard is by force, because that is how force is used. That's
   the only way to communicate.'

   For young people who oppose Macron's anti-Muslim policies, police
   violence, austerity against a backdrop of massive inflation, and the
   escalating war in Ukraine, the social force to mobilize is the working
   class, in France and internationally. It is only through a massive
   mobilization of the working class that we can organize society on a
   socialist basis and solve the burning problems facing young people.

   A man has been arrested after a kidnapping ended in a car crash on the
   corner of Richardson and Maioro roads in the Auckland suburb of New
   Windsor on Sunday night.

   A man has been charged by police after a kidnapping ended in a car
   crash in the Auckland suburb of New Windsor on Sunday night.

   The 20-year-old man allegedly took the victim from a Methuen Rd address
   to a nearby cash machine and forced them to withdraw money before being
   chased by police.

   Police said one of their helicopters spotted the car in Stoddard Rd and
   followed it.

   “The offender refused to stop his vehicle after being sighted by police
   and crashed a short time later, colliding with a member of the public’s
   vehicle at the intersection of Richardson and Maioro roads,” Detective
   Senior Sergeant Steve Anderson said.

   The man allegedly tried to run but was caught by police, leaving the
   kidnapped victim in the car with minor injuries.

   Resident Mark Lewis said he heard “three loud bangs” just before
   11.30pm.

   “We get so many smashes around here that you become numb to them, but
   this made me step back and say, shit what was that?” he said.
   On Monday afternoon debris remained at the site of the crash.

   Jason Dorday/Stuff

   On Monday afternoon debris remained at the site of the crash.

   Lewis said he grabbed a first aid kit and ran up the road, where he saw
   one car with the front “completely blown off” and a second had gone
   through a fence.

   “I’ve never seen police respond so quickly. There must have been five
   or six police cars here within minutes,” Lewis said.

   The family whose fence was crashed into confirmed they were unharmed by
   the incident, but added they are “just really pissed off about the
   whole thing”.

   The impact of the crash was so intense that the tiles of the footpath
   had shifted.

   The impact of the crash was so intense that the tiles of the footpath
   had shifted.

   The man charged will appear in the Auckland District Court on Monday on
   charges of kidnapping, unlawfully taking a vehicle, aggravated robbery,
   threatening to kill and dangerous driving.

   “As the seriousness of these charges indicate, this was an extremely
   distressing incident for all those involved.

   “We are still in the early stages of our investigation and want to
   reassure the community we are not looking for anyone else in relation
   to last night’s events,” Anderson said.

   Anyone who has any information which could help police can contact 105
   and quote file number 220926/7713 or information can also be passed on
   anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.

   Residents in a Dunedin suburb allegedly received a fake tsunami warning

   Supplied
   Residents in a Dunedin suburb allegedly received a fake tsunami warning
   from a teenager with a loudhailer.

   Police are investigating after a teenager allegedly drove around a city
   suburb broadcasting a fake tsunami warning through a loudhailer.

   Residents of low-lying South Dunedin reported a vehicle driving around
   streets and someone urging them to move to higher ground, talking of a
   level five tsunami alert.

   The incident, which unfolded about 9.30pm on Thursday, sparked a police
   investigation, Senior Sergeant Anthony Bond said.

   With no confirmed tsunami, police issued a public statement saying it
   was a hoax.

   They later tracked a vehicle, and its 18-year-old driver to a Jackson
   St address.

   The teenager admitted to driving and playing loud music but denied
   mentioning the tsunami.

   The investigation continues.

'No police, no law': anarchy in Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem

   September 2, 2022 — Jerusalem (AFP)

   One evening in January 2021, Arafe Rajabi, exasperated by yet another
   night of roaring cars below his window in an east Jerusalem Palestinian
   suburb, went downstairs to complain.

   Fifteen minutes later, he was shot dead, another victim of the chaos in
   his Kufr Aqab neighbourhood, a no-man's land which is increasingly
   turning into a local version of the Wild West.

   Located around 10 kilometres (six miles) from the centre of Jerusalem,
   the town is among a handful of locations with a unique status in the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

   Israel considers Kufr Aqab part of Jerusalem, which it fully controls
   after annexing the east of the city in the 1967 war. But to get there
   you need to cross an Israeli military checkpoint and pass a concrete
   wall several meters high which separates Jerusalem from the occupied
   West Bank.

   Tens of thousands of people live in the five-square-kilometre
   (two-square-mile) area, which lies behind the security barrier Israel
   began erecting in 2002 to protect it from deadly Palestinian attacks.

   Neither the Jerusalem municipality nor Israel's interior ministry could
   provide an updated number of Kufr Aqab's residents.

   Most residents have Israeli residency and pay their taxes to the
   Israeli-controlled municipality, allowing them to work in Israel.

   But another part of the neighbourhood is under the Palestinian
   Authority's jurisdiction, with Ramallah-based security forces
   prohibited from operating on the Israeli-annexed side.

   The Israeli police rarely venture into Kufr Aqab, and the lack of
   patrols creates the ideal conditions for crime, arms trade and drug
   trafficking, residents say.

   "There are non-stop gunshots, there is no authority, no police, no
   law," sighed Imane Rajabi, 37, who has been raising her four children
   alone since her husband, Arafe, was shot dead by residents armed with
   M16s.

   "It's a jungle, and you don't know who to complain to," she continued,
   saying it took Israeli police several days to act following her
   husband's death.

   Contacted by AFP, Israeli police said "several suspects were arrested
   and indictments were filed to court" over the killing.

   The police "constantly takes action all over Jerusalem, including in
   the eastern and northern neighbourhoods of the city and in Kufr Aqab,"
   they said in a statement.

   -'Lawless' zone -

   Israel, which annexed east Jerusalem following the 1967 Middle East
   war, considers Kufr Aqab an integral part of its territory, and most of
   its residents have Israeli residency

   But about 10 residents interviewed by AFP described a non-existent
   Israeli police presence and the near-total absence of municipal
   services.

   Besides a few Hebrew signs here and there, there was no indication of
   Israeli jurisdiction and Kufr Aqab, which continues to expand, seems to
   have been increasingly separated from Jerusalem and incorporated into
   the sprawling metropolis of Ramallah.

   In 2017, then-minister for Jerusalem affairs Zeev Elkin acknowledged
   the route taken by the Israeli barrier had been an "error" that had
   turned Kufr Aqab into a "lawless" zone.

   Bullet casings are strewn on the ground in the corner of an alley, and
   rubbish nobody bothers to collect can be found everywhere.

   On the main street, it is not uncommon to see vehicles driving in the
   wrong direction and motorcycles performing wheelies and stunts.
   Colourful billboards assail passers-by, and buildings sprout up without
   any regard to planning rules.

   "The place is up in the air, it doesn't really belong to Israel or the
   Palestinian Authority," said Ziyad Shahade, whose money exchange office
   overlooks the chaotic main road, with its incessant traffic jams and
   horns.

   The Jerusalem municipality told AFP that "despite the many challenges
   created by the erection of the security barrier," it was "doing
   everything in its power to provide [Kufr Aqab] inhabitants with all the
   services they needed and were entitled to."

   A section of Israel's controversial separation wall, erected by the
   Jewish state in 2002 to protect it from attacks, surrounding the Kufr
   Aqab suburb of east Jerusalem

   In reality, "the further away you move to the city centre in the
   direction of Ramallah the lower the level of services," said Daniel
   Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer and Jerusalem expert.

   "When you get to the wall," he said, "the level of municipal services
   collapses."

   The Palestinian Authority said it provided municipal services, but was
   unable to make up for Israeli shortcomings.

   - City limit's -

   According to Seidemann, when Israel seized east Jerusalem, it decided
   to include Kufr Aqab in the city's boundaries since it was sparsely
   populated and near an airport it wanted to use.

   But the airport ceased activity in 2001 during the Second Intifada, or
   Palestinian uprising, and the construction of the Israeli barrier was a
   move to "get rid" of Kufr Aqab by leaving it on the Palestinian side,
   according to the founder of the Israeli anti-settlement NGO Ir Amim.

   Israeli authorities have already considered removing Kufr Aqab from
   Jerusalem's municipal boundaries.

   But any such change in the city's limits would be seen as a potential
   segue to the division of Jerusalem, a red line for Israeli politicians,
   who consider the Holy City "the eternal and indivisible capital" of the
   Jewish state.

   Imane Rajabi says she has paid a heavy price for this nebulous status
   quo.

   Up to 20 years ago, Kufr Aqab was a place "without violence," and
   "without gunshots all day long."

   Now, she's considering leaving the neighbourhood with her children.

   Police Shoot, Kill Man With Knife in Seattle Suburb
   More

   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) — Police in the Seattle suburb of Federal Way
   shot and killed a man after he charged them with a knife on Sunday
   night, the city's police department said.

   The shooting occurred at the Federal Way Transit Center around 9 p.m.

   Federal Way police said they were called to the transit center after a
   man refused to get off a bus. Callers told 911 dispatchers that the
   man, believed to be in his 50s, appeared to be under the influence and
   experiencing a mental health crisis, KING 5 reports.

   A crisis negotiator arrived on the scene to de-escalate the situation,
   a police spokesperson said. During attempts to communicate and
   negotiate, the man tried to start the bus and drive away.

   When he got off the bus he charged officers with a knife, prompting
   police to shoot him, authorities said. The man died at the scene and no
   officers were injured, KING 5 reports.

   The officers involved in the shooting are on administrative leave,
   which is standard protocol, KING 5 reports.

   The Valley Independent Investigation Team, a multiagency team tasked
   with probing officer-involved shootings in south King County, is
   investigating the shooting.

Staffing problems clash with COVID concerns as police hiring in Seattle
suburb stirs debate

   BRIER — Leaders in one Seattle suburb think they’re on the verge of
   solving their police staffing problems at last because several
   experienced cops have applied for the city’s long-vacant positions.

   But there’s a catch.

   Applicants for the jobs in Brier are looking for work because they were
   let go by their previous employers under COVID-19 vaccination mandates,
   residents in the small Snohomish County city were told last week,
   triggering a burst of debate in a community where political views run
   the gamut and raising questions about the next phase of the pandemic.

   As COVID-19 hospitalizations decline and mask mandates lift,
   policy-makers in Brier and across the state are trying to figure out
   what normalcy should look like, and neighbors are wondering whether
   pandemic-era rips in the social fabric can be repaired.

   Whether a person is vaccinated has become not only a matter of medical
   relevance but also “a symbol, part of what represents your belief
   system, kind of like the red hats when Trump was president,” said Brier
   resident Kristina Hawley, who helps moderate a community Facebook group
   where the police hiring issue generated political heat and hundreds of
   comments last week.

   “When you’re calling 911 and the person who responds is someone who
   puts their own interests and desires over their mission to protect and
   serve, that’s no longer the kind of person I want help from,” said
   Hawley, 34, a copy editor with two young children for whom vaccinations
   aren’t yet available. “I’d rather not interact with someone like that.”

   Some residents, including Mayor Dale Kaemingk, are pleased that new
   police Chief Nick Almquist has quickly recruited a number of qualified
   candidates. With a population under 7,000 and almost no commercial tax
   base, the city has struggled over the years to compete against nearby
   jurisdictions for officers, offering lower wages and less action.

   Most of the eight positions in Brier’s police department were vacant at
   one point last year, leading the city to contract with the Snohomish
   County Sheriff’s Office. Almquist was hired in January, partly to
   remedy the situation, which drew complaints when Kaemingk canvassed for
   votes last year, he said.

   “We want to have enough officers,” the mayor said. “I heard that
   message loud and clear.”

   But other residents have concerns about the city’s recruitment stance.
   When Almquist, in a City Council meeting on Feb. 22, described three
   “top-notch candidates” as available because of vaccination mandates,
   Councilmember Martin Krienke voiced trepidation about their judgment,
   and Councilmember Valerie Rosman asked about the potential for an
   outbreak among officers.

   “Hold on a second, guys. I get to speak!” Krienke growled when
   colleagues interrupted his remarks, as tempers in the sleepy meeting
   suddenly flared.

   Some residents have told Rosman they would be “apprehensive about
   reaching out” to unvaccinated officers, but the council member doubts
   Brier can afford to establish a mandate for employees, like Seattle,
   King County and the state, she said in an interview.

   “I do think it will be a conversation,” Rosman said. “Whether everyone
   can come to see it the same way, I don’t know.”

Small suburb

   Best known for its horse arena and large residential lots, Brier is an
   out-of-the-way community with one store and one restaurant. The
   Facebook page where the vaccination debate raged is mostly devoted to
   lost dogs and odd jobs. Brier cops spend much of their time waiting to
   catch speeding motorists.

   The city reported three violent crimes and 69 property crimes in 2020,
   according to an Federal Bureau of Investigation database.

   What counts as excitement? Once upon a time, “my peacock got loose in
   the road,” and neighbors called 911 because they thought the bird’s
   mating call was a screaming girl, recalled Diane Swanberg, 57, a social
   work supervisor and longtime resident.

   Still, there are political tensions. Some older residents with
   generational roots in Brier see things differently than new arrivals,
   Rosman said. Joe Biden carried the city in 2020, though Donald Trump
   cracked 30% in pockets, according to New York Times data.

   “I have a Black Lives Matter sign in my yard that I’ve had to replace
   multiple times, and I’m not the only one,” Hawley said.

   Seattle and Shoreline established vaccination mandates for employees
   last year. But most cities in the region opted against that step,
   Kaemingk said, surprised that residents are now discussing such a
   “late-to-the-game topic.”
   Advertising

   Police staffing has received more attention over the past year, and not
   only in Brier, he said, citing conversations with other Snohomish
   County mayors.

   In that context, accepting applications from unvaccinated officers
   makes sense, said Paula Swisher, Brier’s clerk and treasurer, because
   “I’m just realistic,” Swisher said. “These are candidates who otherwise
   would never darken our door.”

   Two officers currently “in process” to be hired were previously let go
   based on vaccination mandates, Almquist told the council, also sharing
   plans to “wine and dine” a third mandate “victim.”

   The chief didn’t set out to recruit officers in that predicament, he
   said in a later interview, though some other Washington cities, like
   Marysville and Spokane, have used such an approach. King County
   Councilmember Reagan Dunn last month called on County Executive Dow
   Constantine to repeal his vaccination mandate for sheriff’s deputies
   and to reinstate deputies willing to return.

   A fourth Brier candidate, with no vaccination mandate baggage, has
   since applied, Almquist said.

Different views

   No Brier council members are calling for a mandate, with Councilmember
   John Lockhart predicting on Feb. 22 there would be “tremendous
   pushback” against any such attempt.

Sponsored

   Councilmember Mike Gallagher, however, warned there could be “a
   perception issue with the public” about unvaccinated officers. Nearly
   80% of residents in the ZIP code that includes Brier had at least one
   shot as of November, according to the Snohomish Health District.

   The debate whirled on Facebook. “Shame on the city of Brier for
   potentially exposing their citizens,” one person wrote. “Great news
   that we are hiring officers that resisted the tyranny of COVID shot
   mandates,” wrote another.

   Some of the social media sparring was disappointing, Kaemingk said.
   While the mayor is vaccinated, he says Brier should consider applicants
   regardless of status, noting that case counts are way down.

   Almquist is also vaccinated, but is “a strong believer in the right to
   choose,” he said. Brier officers have been directed to wear masks when
   close to other people, though not when responding to high-priority
   calls, the chief said.

   “I hate to get into the science, but whether you’re vaccinated or
   unvaccinated, everybody can get [the virus] and everybody can spread
   it,” he added.

   While breakthrough infections became more common as the omicron variant
   surged, vaccinated people remain less likely to become infected,
   experience severe illness and die, according to the state health
   department. Getting vaccinated can lower your risk of getting and
   spreading the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

   Brier resident Loretta Willwerth was subject to a mandate as a teacher.
   She complied gladly to protect herself and her community, from students
   to at-risk seniors, “so I’m really struggling to understand” the city’s
   approach, said Willwerth, 48, who thinks experienced officers are a
   luxury, considering Brier’s scarce crime.

   “Why not hire a rookie?” she asked.

   Swanberg is also bothered, mostly because she believes police officers
   “should be setting an example” rather than bucking the rules.

   Brier Pizza Kitchen is neutral ground, joked Chris Young, who owns the
   city’s only eatery. When mask mandates for restaurants lift on March
   12, he expects half of his regulars to cheer and the other half to
   fret.

   That sort of divide can put Young, 26, in a tough spot. “Any decision
   that I make,” he said, “is going to alienate a group of people who come
   here.”

   Cleveland Police Probe Shooting Involving Suburban Officer
   More

   CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP) — Cleveland police are investigating a fatal
   shooting involving officers from the suburb of Maple Heights early
   Monday.

   A brief Cleveland police statement said its officers were called at
   around 4:15 a.m. “to assist Maple Heights Police who had been involved
   in an officer involved shooting."

   A man with a gunshot wound was taken to University Hospital and
   pronounced dead, the statement said, adding that no officers were
   injured and a gun was found at the scene.

   The name of the person who was killed and other details weren’t
   immediately released.

   The statement said Maple Heights police had been chasing a man in a
   vehicle they suspected of shooting into homes in the suburb.

   WEWS-TV reported that Maple Heights police had earlier responded to a
   home that was struck by about two dozen bullets. One shot also went
   through the front bedroom of a neighbor's home, narrowly missing a
   sleeping woman and child, the station reported. It was unclear whether
   anyone was injured.

   Neighbors said the home had also been the target of a drive-by shooting
   several months ago, the station reported.

Police: Parade shooting suspect contemplated 2nd shooting

   HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) — The man charged with killing seven people at
   an Independence Day parade confessed to police that he unleashed a hail
   of bullets from a rooftop in suburban Chicago and then fled to the
   Madison, Wisconsin, area, where he contemplated shooting up an event
   there, authorities said Wednesday.

   Robert Crimo III turned back to Illinois, where he was later arrested
   after deciding he was not prepared to pull off a shooting in Wisconsin,
   Lake County Major Crime Task Force spokesman Christopher Covelli said.

   An Illinois judge ordered Crimo to be held without bail. Police found
   the shells of 83 bullets and three ammunition magazines on the rooftop
   that he fired from, Lake County Assistant State’s Attorney Ben Dillon
   said in court.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is a breaking news update. AP’s earlier story is below.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The man charged with killing seven people when he unleashed a hail of
   bullets on an Independence Day parade from a rooftop was expected in
   court Wednesday as authorities faced questions about how he was allowed
   to buy several guns, despite threatening violence.

   Robert E. Crimo III was charged with seven counts of murder Tuesday in
   the shooting that sent hundreds of marchers, parents and children
   fleeing in fear and set off an hourslong manhunt in and around Highland
   Park, an affluent Chicago suburb on the shores of Lake Michigan.
   Investigators have yet to identify a motive.

   Crimo’s attorney said he intends to enter a not guilty plea to all
   charges. Prosecutors have promised to seek dozens more.

   A rifle “similar to an AR-15″ was used to spray more than 70 rounds
   from atop a commercial building into the parade crowd, a spokesman for
   the Lake County Major Crime Task Force said.

   A seventh victim died Tuesday. More than three dozen other people were
   wounded in the attack, which Task force spokesman Christopher Covelli
   said the suspect had planned for several weeks.

   The assault happened less than three years after police went to Crimo’s
   home following a call from a family member who said he was threatening
   “to kill everyone” there. Covelli said police confiscated 16 knives, a
   dagger and a sword, but said there was no sign he had any guns at the
   time, in September 2019.

   Police in April 2019 also responded to a reported suicide attempt by
   the suspect, Covelli said.

   Crimo legally purchased the rifle used in the attack in Illinois within
   the past year, Covelli said. In all, police said, he purchased five
   firearms, which were recovered by officers at his father’s home.

   The revelation about his gun purchases is just the latest example of
   young men who were able to obtain guns and carry out massacres in
   recent months despite glaring warning signs about their mental health
   and inclination to violence.

   Illinois state police, who issue gun owners’ licenses, said Crimo
   applied for a license in December 2019, when he was 19. His father
   sponsored his application.

   At the time “there was insufficient basis to establish a clear and
   present danger” and deny the application, state police said in a
   statement.

   Investigators who have interrogated the suspect and reviewed his social
   media posts have not determined a motive or found any indication that
   he targeted victims by race, religion or other protected status,
   Covelli said.

   At the July 4 parade, the shots were initially mistaken for fireworks
   before hundreds of revelers fled in terror. A day later, baby
   strollers, lawn chairs and other items left behind by panicked parade
   goers remained inside a wide police perimeter. Outside the police tape,
   some residents drove up to collect blankets and chairs they abandoned.

   David Shapiro, 47, said the gunfire quickly turned the parade into
   “chaos.”

   “People didn’t know right away where the gunfire was coming from,
   whether the gunman was in front or behind you chasing you,” he said
   Tuesday as he retrieved a stroller and lawn chairs.

   The shooting occurred at a spot on the parade route where many
   residents had staked out prime viewing points early in the day.

   Among them was Nicolas Toledo, who was visiting his family in Illinois
   from Mexico, and Jacki Sundheim, a lifelong congregant and staff member
   at nearby North Shore Congregation Israel.

   Nine people, ranging from 14 to 70, remained hospitalized Tuesday,
   hospital officials said.

   The shooting was just the latest to shatter the rituals of American
   life. Schools, churches, grocery stores and now community parades have
   all become killing grounds in recent months. This time, the bloodshed
   came as the nation tried to celebrate its founding and the bonds that
   still hold it together.

   The gunman initially evaded capture by dressing as a woman and blending
   into the fleeing crowd, Covelli said.

   A police officer pulled over 21-year-old Crimo north of the shooting
   scene several hours after police released his photo and warned that he
   was likely armed and dangerous, Highland Park Police Chief Lou Jogmen
   said.

   Asked about his client’s emotional state, prominent Chicago-based
   lawyer Thomas A. Durkin said he has spoken to Crimo only once — for 10
   minutes by phone. He declined to comment further.

   In 2013, Highland Park officials approved a ban on semi-automatic
   weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. A local doctor and the
   Illinois State Rifle Association quickly challenged the liberal
   suburb’s stance. The legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court’s
   doorstep in 2015 when justices declined to hear the case and let the
   suburb’s restrictions remain in place.

   Under Illinois law, gun purchases can be denied to people convicted of
   felonies, addicted to narcotics or those deemed capable of harming
   themselves or others. That last provision might have stopped a suicidal
   Crimo from getting a weapon.

   But under the law, who that provision applies to must be decided by “a
   court, board, commission or other legal authority.”

   The state has a so-called red flag law designed to stop dangerous
   people before they kill, but it requires family members, relatives,
   roommates or police to ask a judge to order guns seized.

   Crimo, who goes by the name Bobby, was an aspiring rapper with the
   stage name Awake the Rapper, posting on social media dozens videos and
   songs, some ominous and violent.

   Federal agents were reviewing Crimo’s online profiles, and a
   preliminary examination of his internet history indicated that he had
   researched mass killings and had downloaded multiple photos depicting
   violent acts, including a beheading, a law enforcement official said.

   The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly
   and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

   Shapiro, the Highland Park resident who fled the parade with his
   family, said his 4-year-old son woke up screaming later that night.

   “He is too young to understand what happened,” Shapiro said. “But he
   knows something bad happened.”

   A manhunt is underway in Tennessee for an armed suspect who reportedly
   shot and wounded a police officer during a car chase Monday night,
   authorities said.

   Officers blanketed the area of Gibson Drive in Madison, a suburb in
   northeast Nashville, in search of the suspect, identified as
   34-year-old Samuel Quinton Edwards, the Metro Nashville Police
   Department said. Edwards has yet to be caught as of Tuesday morning.

   "Edwards should be considered armed and extremely dangerous," the
   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.

   The shooting unfolded during a pursuit that ended on Gibson Drive,
   according to investigators. Edwards allegedly fired shots at a
   Hendersonville police officer’s patrol vehicle, striking the officer.

   After the Edwards reportedly opened fire on the officer, police said
   the suspect abandoned his van and fled on foot while armed with two
   guns.

   MUSKEGON, MI -- A former gang crimes specialist from the Chicago
   suburbs has been offered the public safety director position in
   Muskegon.

   Vincent Acevez, who most recently was police chief of a community
   college, was the sole finalist for the position that oversees
   Muskegon’s police, fire and building inspections department.

   Muskegon City Manager Frank Peterson told MLive/Muskegon Chronicle he
   offered Acevez the position Wednesday afternoon, March 30.

   Peterson said while Acevez has impressive leadership experience, he was
   most impressed with his ability to connect with others while he was in
   town meeting with community stakeholders.

   “He has a great personality,” Peterson said. “It’s a refreshing
   personality. It’s not a suit coming in here, so to speak.”

   Assuming Acevez takes the job, he will replace Jeff Lewis, who is
   retiring as the city’s public safety director on April 30.

   When contacted by MLive Wednesday afternoon, Acevez said he had not yet
   seen the offer and would have to take time to consider it before
   deciding if he would accept it.

   “I have a family, and we have to make that decision together,” he said.

   The salary range for the public safety director position is $89,272 to
   $118,553, depending on relevant experience. Peterson said he expects
   the city will negotiate with Acevez on where he lands on that wage
   scale.

   From the Western Springs suburb of Chicago, Acevez spent 18 years with
   the gang crimes division of the police department at Cicero, Illinois.
   While there, he was credited for significant reduction in gang
   activity, which Acevez attributed to the police department making
   connections within the community.

   From 2000 through 2018, Acevez worked his way up from gang officer to
   sergeant and then commander of the 30-member Gang Crimes Tactical Unit.
   From 2019 to mid-2021, he was the deputy superintendent of the Cicero
   Police Department’s 130-member patrol division.

   Cicero has a population of about 85,300 people, 89% of whom are Latino,
   according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The town’s population is about 4%
   Black and 7% white. The median household income is about $54,000,
   according to the census.

   In comparison, Muskegon is significantly smaller, with about 38,300
   people, and is 50% white, 32% Black and 11% Latino. The median
   household income in Muskegon is $35,323.

   proves naysayers wrong in 10-year run

   After leaving the Cicero Police Department, Acevez was an investigator
   with the Illinois Department of Transportation from May to August 2021.
   He was police chief at Morton College, a community college in Cicero,
   from August 2021 to January.

   In 2018, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recognized Cicero as a
   “Culture of Health” award winner. It was, according to the foundation,
   an example of a community improving its health by tackling gang
   violence – a community-driven effort that started in 2008, according to
   the foundation.

   At that time, the foundation noted that gang-related homicides had
   dropped to one in 2017 from 14 in 2004.

   “I tell people it wasn’t us,” Acevez told the foundation for a 2018
   article. “It was the community becoming involved in our department.”

   Acevez was among 14 people who applied to become Muskegon’s next public
   safety director. He and Grand Haven Public Safety Director Jeff Hawke,
   who oversees police, fire and building code departments in that
   community, were named as the two finalists.

   However, Hawke earlier this week withdrew from consideration, citing
   “family reasons,” Peterson told MLive.

   Peterson said that while Acevez has not had direct supervision of fire
   or police departments, he has “a significant amount of experience”
   working with them in his previous positions.

   The job offer made to Acevez is one of the final decisions of Peterson,
   whose last day with the city is Thursday, March 31. Peterson has chosen
   to take a job in the private sector.

Trump lost America’s suburbs. Now the GOP might be about to win them back

   Summerlin, Nevada CNN  —

   Republicans’ path to control of the US House winds through suburbs like
   the ones that ring the sprawling metropolis of Las Vegas here in
   Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, where Democratic Rep. Susie Lee is
   fighting for a third term.

   During the presidency of Donald Trump, the GOP lost significant ground
   in the suburbs as he alienated voters with his pugnacious style and
   self-serving rhetoric. Now the party is trying to win back many of
   those voters with a focus on crime and economic discontent, traversing
   suburban battlegrounds here in Nevada, which is home to three
   competitive House races, a high-profile gubernatorial race and a
   pivotal Senate contest.

   In the House, the GOP only needs a net gain of five seats to win, and
   their success – and the size of their potential majority – could hinge
   on turning out voters like 47-year-old Cindy Broussard, who works
   security at a local hotel and casino but took on a second job as a home
   health care aide to shoulder the crush of inflation.

   Interactive: Nevada, one of six states to watch for the 2022 midterms

   The Silver State’s tourism-fueled economy was pummeled by the Covid-19
   pandemic and it now has one of the highest inflation rates in the
   nation. Gas prices have dropped but are still above $5 a gallon – the
   fifth highest among the 50 states. That sour economic climate and
   concerns about rising crime have provided a clear opening for the GOP
   after an era in which disdain for Trump dramatically eroded their
   support among suburban voters, particularly women.

   “Everybody’s gone through their savings and beyond,” said Broussard,
   who is leaning toward Republican candidates this cycle, as she unloaded
   “the essentials” from her grocery cart on a recent afternoon. She has
   stopped buying soda. She has cut back on meat and condiments. She no
   longer contemplates splurging on the makings “for a great dinner” –
   just what she can afford to “survive and get through it.”

   “I’m literally working 84, 85 hours a week to cover the same bills,”
   Broussard said. She laughed when asked whether she expects to reap
   savings from the Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act,” the sweeping
   $750 billion health care, tax and climate law that Democrats say is
   intended to help put more money into the pockets of working Americans.

   “What is the reduction?” she asks. “You say you’ve done all these
   things,” she said of Democrats, “but where is it at?”

   Broussard’s frustrations encapsulate both the challenge facing
   Democrats and the opportunity for Republicans. Recent polling has shown
   that economic concerns are paramount – eclipsing all other issues,
   including abortion – and that was true in more than two dozen
   interviews with voters throughout the suburbs of Las Vegas.

   Political mood tilts in Republicans' favor with economy and inflation
   top of mind three weeks from midterms

   The Supreme Court’s decision overturning abortion rights in June helped
   Democrats close their enthusiasm gap, potentially boosting turnout on
   their side. But independent voters continue to prioritize the economy.
   And several Republican strategists argued in interviews that many
   suburban voters and independents increasingly see this election as a
   referendum on their family’s economic and physical security, two
   powerful motivators for female voters who have otherwise turned away
   from the GOP in recent years.

   “Suburban districts are at the core of the House battleground,” said
   Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which
   provides non-partisan analysis of campaigns. “Republicans are primed to
   make gains in the suburbs. Voters that opposed Trump or were turned off
   by Trump are now looking at the current state of the country and the
   current state of the economy and they don’t like what they see. But
   they do see Democrats in charge.”

   Though many different factors have driven up inflation and gas prices,
   it’s the party in power that often gets the blame. “Democrats are being
   held responsible for the vast majority of the problems that the country
   is facing, because they’re in control,” he said.

GOP looks to win over voters with crime messaging

   Among the 18 congressional districts that Inside Elections rates as
   toss-ups, Gonzales noted that at least nine have significant suburban
   populations, including Colorado’s 8th, Minnesota’s 2nd, Nebraska’s 2nd,
   New Jersey’s 7th, Oregon’s 5th and 6th, Pennsylvania’s 7th, Virginia’s
   2nd and Washington’s 8th. There are many other key suburban districts
   in seats that are currently tilting toward one of the parties.

   In many of them, Republicans have run countless ads trying to tie
   Democratic candidates to the calls by some progressive groups to defund
   the police following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a police
   officer. Even though most Democratic elected officials did not support
   that message – and have often echoed President Joe Biden’s calls in his
   State of the Union address to “fund the police” – the GOP has continued
   to raise the slogan as a boogeyman, linking it with the uptick in crime
   in some parts of the country. A Gallup poll from earlier this year
   found 72% of Americans were dissatisfied with the current policies to
   reduce or control crime.

   Fact check: The GOP's dishonesty-filled barrage of 'defund the police'
   attack ads

   The messages on crime could have particular salience in districts like
   Oregon 5th and 6th Districts, which include suburbs around Portland, a
   city where some of the protests after Floyd’s death turned violent.

   An ad from Congressional Leadership Fund, the Republican super PAC tied
   to House GOP leadership, targeting progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner,
   for example, shows images of rioting and burning buildings juxtaposed
   against recent headlines about the increase in violent crime in
   Portland, suggesting that McLeod-Skinner would stand with “defund the
   police radicals.”

   McLeod-Skinner, who defeated moderate Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in
   the primary and is now facing Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the
   former mayor of Happy Valley, tweeted that she is “the only candidate
   in this race with a consistent record of funding the police.”

   In Oregon’s 6th District, which also includes parts of suburban
   Portland, an ad attacking Democratic state legislator Andrea Salinas
   from the National Republican Congressional Committee and GOP opponent
   Mike Erickson states that Salinas “voted numerous times to defund the
   police,” but none of the bills cited in the ad defunded the police.
   Salinas told the Salem Statesman Journal the accusation was “patently
   false.”

   In Nevada, the messages blaming Democrats for crime and economic
   struggles are being echoed in the barrage of ads for races up and down
   the ticket – from the US Senate race where former state Attorney
   General Adam Laxalt is challenging Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez
   Masto, to the governor’s race where Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo
   is trying to unseat Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, to the three House
   seats that the GOP hopes to flip.

   Republican April Becker, who is challenging Lee in the 3rd District,
   has highlighted her own early journey as a single mom who worked as a
   waitress and a bartender. Becker, who became a lawyer at 39, argued in
   one of her ads that she’s now able to “help people who are struggling
   just like I was.” In another ad – attacking Lee while standing in front
   of a gas pump – Becker says of members of Congress: “They just don’t
   care about us.”

   Democrats, in turn, have focused on Becker’s position on abortion. One
   ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee falsely stated
   that Becker would join Republicans “trying to ban abortion nationwide,
   including Nevada” even though Becker has explicitly stated that she
   would not vote for a nationwide ban, because she believes it “would be
   unconstitutional.”

   Super PACs get less favorable advertising rates than candidates. But
   when it comes to outside spending, the Congressional Leadership Fund
   has been able to outspend the Democrats’ House Majority PAC – $168.3
   million to $124.7 million, including future reservations, as of
   Thursday. HMP has spent more on advertising about abortion than any
   other issue, while CLF has focused on taxes, inflation and crime, as
   well as unflattering depictions of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and
   Biden.

   Both super PACs have spent more in Nevada’s 3rd District in the
   expensive Las Vegas media market than any other race – about $9.8
   million by CLF and nearly $4.8 by HMP, according to an analysis of
   AdImpact data from January 2021 through Election Day, which includes
   future ad reservations. Among the ads that HMP spent the most to air
   since Labor Day weekend was one focused on abortion – targeting Becker
   as “a dangerous threat to the women of Nevada.”

   Meanwhile, Broussard said she doesn’t understand the Democratic focus
   on abortion. She favors abortion rights and disagrees with the extreme
   bans that have been put in place in some red states. But she noted that
   voters in Nevada protected abortion rights with a 1990 referendum.

   “All their talk is about abortion – who’s fighting for it or not – they
   can fight all they want. It’s us people that have to vote on that,” she
   said. This election, she added, “it’s all about the economy. The
   working class – we want to know what’s going to happen to us.”

High sticker prices drown out Democratic legislative accomplishments

   Nevada Democrats are increasingly pushing back on the economic
   messaging from the GOP by noting that Republicans have put forward very
   few specifics about what they would do to bring down costs for average
   families.

   Lee, along with Nevada’s two other vulnerable House Democrats, Dina
   Titus in the 1st District and Steven Horsford in the 4th District, have
   also amplified the message that Republicans’ vows to reduce spending
   and debt – if they win the majority – could endanger Social Security
   and Medicare.

   Lee argued that it “hasn’t been a challenge at all” to get the word out
   about how Democrats’ legislative accomplishments could change the lives
   of voters. She noted that many seniors are relieved that the recently
   passed package will allow Medicare to negotiate the price of certain
   prescription drugs, in addition to lowering other health care costs.

   Here's how Republicans would address inflation

   “This is money in people’s pockets,” Lee said after a recent event
   focused on Social Security and Medicare. “We hear over and over again
   stories of seniors who go without life-saving medications, seniors who
   are cutting their pills in half because they can’t afford it. This
   legislation not only saves money, but it will save lives.”

   But in interviews with voters here, most expressed frustration rather
   than gratitude for the Democrats’ legislative endeavors in Washington.

   Many of them lacked a basic grasp of what was included in the
   Democrats’ much-touted health care, tax and climate bill. They pointed
   instead to the myriad ways in which they have had to adjust to the
   bruising effects of inflation.

   One voter who declined to give her name noted that she can no longer
   buy flowers to brighten her home. Another, incensed, held up a
   two-pound block of Colby cheddar cheese that she said had doubled in
   price since her last visit to Smith’s grocery store in Summerlin.

   Those kinds of frustrations have led Stephanie Brambila, a 38 year-old
   voter, to give Republican candidates a second look this year.
   “Everything’s gone up instead of down. And I think it’s going to get
   worse,” she said outside a Costco west of Las Vegas.

   “I didn’t care for Trump, but Trump was better for the economy,”
   Brambila said, pointing to some of Trump’s racially charged rhetoric
   about Mexicans and immigrants. “But we voted for Biden and then
   regretted it, because he didn’t do better.”

   Jackie Zavala, an independent 48-year-old business owner, said she
   doesn’t like some of Biden’s decisions. “It’s crazy to be involved in
   all these other countries,” she said, pointing to the aid the US has
   sent to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. “It’s not our business.
   Why do they spend the money (when) we need the money here?”

   Still, she said she is likely to stick with Democrats this year,
   because she thinks they are trying to make things better.

   Kathy Beehn, a 77-year-old Democrat, said she hopes that voters
   understand that that there are other factors driving inflation –
   pointing to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. She said it
   is unfair that Biden and the Democrats are being blamed.

   At the same time, she described Biden as “a very relaxed president.”

   “I wish he had a little more pep in his step. But I think he’s trying.
   We were in pretty bad shape to start with.”

   ADDS THAT POLICE OFFICER HAS DIED - Police investigate the scene of a
   shooting on Tuesday, Oct. 26, 2021, at the Speedway gas station in
   Pontoon Beach., Ill. A police officer died Tuesday after being shot by
   a man at gas station in an Illinois suburb of St. Louis, authorities
   said. (Christian Gooden/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) The Associated
   Press

   PONTOON BEACH, Ill. (AP) — A man shot and seriously wounded a police
   officer Tuesday at a gas station in an Illinois suburb of St. Louis,
   authorities said.

   The Pontoon Beach officer was shot at around 8 a.m. at a Speedway gas
   station along Route 111 near its junction with Interstate 270 and was
   rushed to Saint Louis University Hospital, police said.

   Michael Fillback, the police chief in neighboring Edwardsville, told
   the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the officer was in “bad shape.”

   State Police Trooper Jayme Bufford told the newspaper that the Pontoon
   Beach officer had approached a car in the gas station's parking lot
   because he suspected it had been stolen, and that a man began firing on
   him.

   The suspect was taken into custody, said the State Police, who are
   investigating the shooting.

   Edwardsville police spokesman Michael Fillback told KSDK-TV that he
   didn't know the wounded officer’s condition and that police were trying
   to determine what led to the shooting.

   “We would ask the public for their prayers for the officer, his family
   and the Pontoon Beach Police Department," Fillback said.

Youths clash with police in Paris suburb

   Youths clashed with police into the early hours of Monday in a Paris
   suburb after the death of a young man in a motorcycle accident, which
   some in the community blamed on the police, Le Parisien newspaper and
   residents reported.

   The trouble in Argenteuil, a suburb on the northern outskirts of Paris,
   marks the latest outbreak of disorder as France's strict lockdown rules
   to tackle the novel coronavirus have increased social tensions.

   Videos posted on social media showed teams of CRS riot police moving
   into housing estates. Some youths let off fireworks, while bins had
   been set on fire and police tear gas swirled in the air.

   Associates of the deceased accident victim, identified as Sabri Choubi,
   18, said his death was caused by a collision with a police car.

   Officials at the Paris police department did not immediately respond to
   a request for a comment.

   Clashes broke out in various council housing estates around Paris last
   month.

   France's banlieues – high-rise, low-income neighborhoods that encircle
   many of its cities – are frequently flashpoints of anger over social
   and economic inequality and allegations of heavy-handed policing.

   overland park incident action plan
   By: Sarah Plake
   Posted at 5:26 PM, Jul 05, 2022
   and last updated 2022-07-05 20:03:28-04

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. — After the mass shooting that killed seven people in
   an Illinois suburb, KSHB 41 News spoke with police departments in the
   Kansas City area about their safety plans for larger gatherings.

   John Lacy, the public information officer for the Overland Park Police
   Department, couldn't get into detail about what's in an Incident Action
   Plan.

   However, Lacy says for every 5K or fireworks display, they always have
   one ready days in advance.

   "They always change. We may see an incident like Highland Park and
   we're going to look at that incident, find out what did they do good,
   what did they do bad, how can we improve safety here in Overland Park
   for our citizens," Lacy said.

   Like Highland Park, Illinois, where a shooter hiding on a rooftop shot
   into a 4th of July parade, Overland Park is a suburb.

   Overland Park police were on high alert Monday at the annual Corporate
   Woods fireworks display and had extra resources.

   "There were officers that stepped up and said, 'Hey, if you need me out
   there, I'm willing to come out there,'" Lacy said. "We also had
   officers in plainclothes that were mingling with the crowd."

   They had public works trucks blocking pedestrian areas to avoid someone
   driving through a crowd, taking notes from the 2016 incident in Nice,
   France, where a man plowed through a group of people at a Bastille Day
   celebration.

   OPPD was certainly aware of the need to have resources in high places
   like rooftops.

   "We have eyes everywhere," Lacy said.

   Lacy also stresses situational awareness. He said the police depend on
   every day people to keep their eyes open.

   If you see a post on social media and it doesn't sit right with you,
   tell someone about it, Lacy said.

   If you're at an event and you see something or someone and you get a
   bad gut feeling, don't hesitate to tell a police officer.

   Highland Park is actually more similar in size to Leawood, Kansas.

   Highland Park's population is about 30,000 and its police force is made
   up of 57 officers and 12 civilian employees.

   Leawood's population is 34,000 and its police force has 61 officers and
   22 support personnel.

   "I think what you're going to see is more use of unmanned aerial
   systems such as drones," John Hamilton, a retired Kansas City police
   officer, said.

   Hamilton is also a criminal justice associate professor emeritus at
   Park University. He says drones can be useful for smaller departments
   without a lot of resources, such as a helicopter.

   "Where you can get a drone that's well-equipped, that has a camera
   above it, that's fairly quiet, that you could use to do continual
   surveillance as well," Hamilton said.

   When a mass shooting happens, Hamilton says his mind always goes to
   what information was there before that could have prevented it.

   It's unclear what kind of surveillance Highland Park and its police
   department had at the parade, like snipers on rooftops, drones or
   helicopters.

   "So when I look at what was yesterday I look and say, I don't know how
   you would have prevented it short of maybe having intelligence
   information prior to the event," Hamilton said.

   Hamilton said 20 to 25 years ago, police weren't worried about
   high-powered weapons, like the Highland Park suspect had.

   "I think what's changed is some of the tactics that the shooters have
   begun to use and plans have begun to evolve to meet those needs,"
   Hamilton said.

   This after-action doesn't prevent the loss of life but he says
   pinpointing what they can do better next time is critical.

   The Kansas City Police Department also responded to KSHB 41 News'
   request, saying they've had the opportunity to plan for several large
   events during the last 10 years with a World Series win, a Super Bowl
   win, and many parades.

   KCPD has a Critical Incident Management plan in place that covers
   large-scale disasters and other incidents.

   "Our members train regularly in active shooter response," Officer Donna
   Drake, a spokesperson for KCPD, said. "We work with the FBI, the Fusion
   Center, as well as regional and local partners to gather and
   disseminate information regarding potential threats."

   Drake said they also work with schools, hospitals, and other private
   businesses to provide them with active shooter training.

   Interim Chief Mabin spoke about active shooter situations at the June
   28th Board of Police Commissioners meeting, following the Uvalde school
   shooting.

   Mabin said training for all officers is ongoing.

Michigan man fatally shot by police after he killed his wife; his daughter
blames incident on QAnon conspiracy theory

   A woman called 911 and "stated that her dad shot her and her mother" in
   the Detroit suburb of Walled Lake, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office
   said.

   Police killed a shotgun-wielding man, reportedly driven to violence by
   his belief in QAnon conspiracy theories, after he fatally shot his wife
   and wounded their daughter in suburban Detroit, officials said Monday.

   A 25-year-old woman called 911 at about 4:11 a.m. Sunday and "stated
   that she had just been shot by her father" on Glenwood Drive in Walled
   Lake, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

   When deputies and Walled Lake police arrived at the home, the man,
   identified as Igor Lanis, 53, came out the front door with a Remington
   870 pump action shotgun and started shooting at officers, the sheriff's
   office said.

   Lanis' gunfire struck "a car an officer was behind and the residence
   behind him," although no one "was injured from those shots," the
   sheriff's office said Monday.

   A Walled Lake police officer and an Oakland County sheriff's deputy
   returned fire, killing Lanis, officials said.

   The 911 caller was "at the front door ... attempting to crawl from the
   home" before officers "dragged her to safety," authorities said.

   She was taken to a hospital and rushed into emergency surgery, the
   sheriff's office said, adding that the woman had been upgraded from
   critical condition to stable.

   Officials found the man's wife and the family dog dead inside the home.

   The wife, Tina Lanis, 56, had been "shot multiple times in the back,
   and it appears that she was also attempting to flee out of the front
   door," the sheriff's office said.

   The slain dog, a Great Pyrenees, also was shot multiple times.

   The sheriff's office said Monday it still wasn't clear what might have
   touched off the horrific rampage.

   "As part of this ongoing investigation, they are seeking insight into
   what set this into motion leading to a resident fatally shooting his
   wife, shooting and seriously injuring his daughter and killing the
   family dog," a sheriff's statement said.

   His other daughter, Rebecca Lanis, who was not wounded Sunday, told the
   Detroit News that her father suffered mental health challenges that she
   pinned on conspiracy theories and extremist ideologies he picked up
   online.

   “I think that he was always prone to [mental issues], but it really
   brought him down when he was reading all those weird things on the
   internet,” Lanis told the newspaper.

   She said her father got worse after Donald Trump lost the presidential
   election in 2020, embracing “crazy ideas” online, such as QAnon.

   Rebecca Lanis told the News that she was the author of a statement on a
   subreddit page called "QAnonCasualties" that blamed her father's issues
   on the false but widespread conspiracy theory about — among many other
   things — Trump's leading a top-secret war on a cabal of pedophiles and
   criminals.

   She cursed QAnon supporters and said she hopes "the FBI tightens its
   grip on you" so such conspiracy theorists someday "rot in prison (and
   hell) for poisoning so many people."

   Sheriff Michael Bouchard on Monday thanked dispatchers, police and his
   deputies for their fast work.

   “This is an unbelievably horrific act,” Bouchard said in a statement.
   “It is so sad on so many levels but due to the response and
   professionalism of our dispatch, the Walled Lake officers and Oakland
   County Sheriff’s Office Deputies at least one victim was saved. We will
   actively pursue information to gain insight into what set this into
   motion.”

   Police: Shooter at Apartment Complex Kills 2, Then Himself
   More

   BROWN DEER, Wis. (AP) — A man fatally shot two people at an apartment
   complex in a Milwaukee suburb and later died of an apparent
   self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

   Three people, including the suspect, were killed and one other person
   was injured in Saturday morning's shooting, which authorities believe
   began as a “domestic dispute,” Brown Deer Police Chief Peter Nimmer
   said.

   He said the 26-year-old suspect shot himself and was taken to a
   hospital, where he died.

   Nimmer said a 31-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were also killed.
   A 36-year-old man was shot in the leg.

   A child in the apartment was not hurt, he said.

   Nimmer said he did not know the "relationships of all involved."

   Police were called to the Park Plaza Court apartments shortly after 10
   a.m. The suspect fired shots at officers from the second floor but no
   officers were hurt, although a police car was hit. Nimmer said no
   officers returned fire and officers afterward heard only one more round
   fired — likely the self-inflicted gunshot.

   Local news outlets reported earlier that police vehicles, ambulances
   and fire department vehicles had gathered outside the apartment complex
   and that a Milwaukee County medical examiner had been called to the
   scene.

Police say they stopped a planned July 4 mass shooting in Virginia's capital

   Police in Richmond, Virginia, said Wednesday that they thwarted a
   planned July 4 mass shooting after receiving a tip that led to the
   arrest of two men and the seizure of multiple guns — an announcement
   that came just two days after a deadly mass shooting on the holiday in
   a Chicago suburb.

   A "hero citizen" overheard a conversation indicating there was an
   attack being planned on the city's popular Independence Day celebration
   and called police to report it, Police Chief Gerald Smith said at a
   news conference.

   Police initiated an investigation, along with the U.S. Department of
   Homeland Security and FBI, which led to the arrests of two men on
   charges of being a non-U.S. citizen in possession of a firearm.
   Additional charges are possible, Smith said.

   Officers seized two assault rifles, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of
   ammunition from a residence where the firearms and "related material"
   were in plain view, Smith said.

   The two men were being held without bond at a local jail, the chief
   said.

   The apparent thwarted plot was planned for the same day that a gunman
   opened fire from a rooftop during a Fourth of July parade in the
   affluent Chicago suburb of Highland Park, killing seven people and
   injuring more than three dozen.

   Robert E. Crimo III was charged with seven counts of murder Tuesday.
   The shooting sent hundreds of people fleeing in fear and set off an
   hourslong manhunt. Authorities have not yet identified a motive in that
   shooting.

Israeli at Highland Park parade recalls moment he realized fireworks were

   July 4, 2022. (screen capture: NBC5 Chicago)

   Chicago — An Israeli at yesterday’s Highland Park 4th of July parade
   recalls the first moments of the shooting in an interview with The
   Times of Israel, noting that responses to the incident from locals have
   seemed far more “drastic” than what they would have been had such an
   event taken place in Israel.

   Chaim Vachman moved with his family to the nearby suburb of Deerfield
   from the central Israeli town of Mazkeret Batya in 2019 and was at the
   Highland Park parade with his wife and seven-year-old daughter, less
   than 200 feet from where the bullets sprayed.

   Vachman, 45, says he did not register the initial gunshots, assuming
   they were fireworks, but realized that he was in the midst of a
   mass-shooting attack when he heard the gunman, Robert Crimo, lock in
   his second bullet magazine. He glanced at his wife who quickly ran with
   their daughter away from the shooting while Vachman stayed behind and
   took cover.

   Explaining his decision not to flee with the rest of the crowd, Vachman
   says, “I didn’t feel like the bullets were coming in my direction. If I
   ran away, I would be with my back to the incident, and I wouldn’t have
   been unable to properly respond.”

   The Israeli Navy veteran was armed at the time but did not draw his
   weapon, noting that there were already dozens of police officers there
   and that his doing so would have sparked more chaos.

   mass shooting at the Highland Park 4th of July parade on July 4, 2022.

   Vachman admits that gun carriers are relatively rare in the north shore
   suburbs. “Guns are seen as something impure, and people living here
   prefer to view it as a sterile bubble, regardless of the fact that
   seven other people were gunned down in Chicago on the same weekend.”

   The Israeli expat also notes how locals have had a much more difficult
   time processing the incident, given that such mass shootings are far
   less commonplace in Highland Park than in Israel.

   “People here are very emotional and easily have taken this kind of
   incident to all sorts of drastic directions,” Vachman says, pointing to
   announcements by nearby towns to cancel their respective 4th of July
   parades after news of the shooting broke and the decisions by locals to
   continue sheltering in place even after it was clear that the threat
   had subsided.

   “These reactions are human and happen everywhere, but in Israel, people
   are more used to this sort of thing and the circle of panic isn’t as
   wide,” he says.

   Still, Vachman says the experience has not changed his perception of
   the area or his family’s plans to stay in the Chicago area for the
   foreseeable future.
   Israeli politics told straight

   I joined The Times of Israel after many years covering US and Israeli
   politics for Hebrew news outlets.

   I believe responsible coverage of Israeli politicians means presenting
   a 360 degree view of their words and deeds – not only conveying what
   occurs, but also what that means in the broader context of Israeli
   society and the region.

   That’s hard to do because you can rarely take politicians at face value
   – you must go the extra mile to present full context and try to
   overcome your own biases.

   I’m proud of our work that tells the story of Israeli politics straight
   and comprehensively. I believe Israel is stronger and more democratic
   when professional journalists do that tough job well.

   Your support for our work by joining The Times of Israel Community
   helps ensure we can continue to do so.

Car rams two police motorcyclists in Paris suburb -police

   (BUTTON) Read full article
   April 27, 2020, 10:51 PM·1 min read

   PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - A motorist deliberately drove his car into
   two police motorcyclists on patrol in a Paris suburb on Monday, gravely
   injuring both, police unions said.

   The incident took place in Colombes in the northwestern outskirts of
   Paris.

   Video footage circulating on social media and on the website of daily
   newspaper Le Parisien showed one motorbike sandwiched between the
   crumpled bonnets of a police car and a black BMW. Debris from a second
   bike lay strewn on the road.

   "Two police motorcyclists in a serious condition after being
   deliberately hit in Colombes by an individual who also rammed a police
   car. Thoughts with our colleagues," the Synergie-Officiers union wrote
   on social media.

   Interior Minister Christophe Castaner hailed the response of officers
   who gave first aid to their comrades at the scene.

   "My thoughts go out to the two injured policemen who were committed to
   protecting us," Castaner wrote on Twitter.

   Police sources called the incident a deliberate act. Sources familiar
   with the investigation said the perpetrator targeted the officers to
   avenge events in Palestine.

   France's anti-terrorism prosecutor has so far not been called on to
   lead the investigation.

   France has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants. Police and
   soldiers have been targeted on multiple occasions in recent years.

   In October, an information technology assistant at the police
   headquarters in central Paris went on a knife rampage inside the
   building, killing four people before he was shot dead. He had converted
   to Islam a decade earlier.

   A Palestinian gunman has killed five people in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
   It's the latest in a series of attacks that left 11 people dead in just
   over a week.

   A MARTINEZ, HOST:

   In Israel, a gunman has killed five people in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
   It's the latest in a series of attacks that have left 11 dead in just
   over a week. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is calling it a new wave of
   terror. And officials say some of the attackers support the Islamic
   State group, a rare phenomenon in Israel. NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Tel
   Aviv. Daniel, what more can you tell us about these attacks?

   DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Well, they've all happened in Israeli cities.
   Last week in Beersheba in the south, there was a rampage. An attacker
   used his car and then stabbed and killed four Israelis. Then this
   weekend in another city, Hadera, there was a pair of gunmen that killed
   two Israeli policemen. And then last night in Bnei Brak, right outside
   of Tel Aviv, a Palestinian gunmen from the West Bank - Israeli media
   report he was previously imprisoned in Israel. He opened fire, killed
   five people, including what we hear are two Ukrainians working here for
   several years and a policeman.

   MARTINEZ: And is the motivation for this known yet?

   ESTRIN: Well, officials said in the first two attacks the attackers
   were ISIS supporters. And we've been seeing in the last few days
   arrests of ISIS supporters. And ISIS supporters is highly rare in
   Israel. But on top of that, there is a different feeling that this may
   be a general wave of Palestinian attacks kind of like what we have seen
   in recent years - attacks that are not necessarily directed from from
   the top, but some kind of momentum that gathers and inspires copycat
   attacks. In the Palestinian territories, this is being described as
   resistance against Israeli occupation. We've seen gatherings, for
   instance, outside the attacker's house from last night.

   MARTINEZ: And what's been the response politically?

   ESTRIN: Well, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called it
   murderous Arab terror. He's describing it as a new phenomenon.
   Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a rare
   condemnation of last night's attack. And then on the streets, we've
   been seeing Israeli far-right protests at sites of - some of the sites
   of these attacks. We've heard chants like death to Arabs. Israelis
   torched Palestinians' cars and vowed revenge in one village. And we're
   seeing thousands of police today dispatched across the country. And
   people are jittery. I've heard from Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel
   who are afraid to go out on the streets to Jewish areas. We saw this
   morning police shoot at the legs of some Palestinians in a busy
   Jerusalem market - perhaps a case of mistaken identity. And some
   Israeli cities and even in West Bank settlements are limiting
   construction sites now because a lot of Palestinian workers come in for
   construction. And these cities don't want Palestinians coming in today.

   MARTINEZ: So you said people are jittery. So there must be fears that
   things could get worse or maybe grow into a larger wave of violence.

   ESTRIN: That's right. And the U.S. has actually been fearing this for
   many weeks now. They have been warning that violence ahead of next
   month's Muslim holy month of Ramadan. They're worried of what happened
   last year, when there was violence leading to the Gaza conflict around
   this time of year. So they have been urging officials to meet to try to
   take steps to prevent violence. We've seen Israeli and Palestinian
   leaders meeting. We've seen Israeli and Jordanian officials meeting.
   Jordan plays a role here as the custodian of the Al-Aqsa mosque in
   Jerusalem. So Israel's president is meeting the king of Jordan today.
   It is unclear, though, if this really can be stopped, if this is a wave
   of lone wolf attackers not directed. And especially with Jewish,
   Christian, Muslim holidays coming up next month, this is a recipe for
   more tension.

   MARTINEZ: NPR's Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv. Daniel, thanks.

   ESTRIN: You're welcome.

Former suburban Chicago police officer accused of dragging 66-year-old woman
back in court on Monday

   DIXMOOR, Illinois - Ronald Burge Jr., a former police commander in the
   Chicago suburb of Dixmoor, is scheduled to be in court on Monday for a
   hearing on aggravated battery charges after he allegedly dragged a
   66-year-old woman and slammed her into a wall.

   Cook County prosecutors said that Burge Jr., whose father is the police
   chief of Dixmoor, confronted Carla Bourgouis when she came to the
   Dixmoor police station after her grandson was arrested in January 2020.

   Burge arrested the boy’s father when he refused to hand over a
   cellphone he was using to record their conversation. Bourgouis said she
   then also began recording, Burge demanded she give him her cellphone,
   and she began to leave the station.

   Burge chased after Bourgouis, carried her back in, and "then
   purposefully slammed the victim’s face into the back hallway wall on
   three separate occasions," prosecutors said.

   Dixmoor Police Chief Ronald Burge Sr., the former commander’s father,
   defended his son’s actions.

   All charges against Bourgouis were dropped by prosecutors. Mondayʼs
   hearing for Burge is a status hearing.

‘Uneconomical and ineffective’: Police Minister rejects petition for
permanent police presence in Karama

   by Independent Staff | Oct 21, 2022 | Cops, News | 0 comments

   Calls for a permanent police presence in the crime-ridden suburb of
   Karama by more than a thousand residents have been rejected by the
   Fyles Government.

   The demands were backed by a Labor MLA and a Darwin alderman for a 24/7
   police presence for the vicinity in and around Karama Shopping Plaza,
   but were rejected by Police Minister Kate Worden, who said that the
   demand is “uneconomical” and that the crime rate in the area had
   dropped over the past 12 months – points the proponents disagree with.

   In a letter responding to the petition stated by Karama MLA Ngaree Ah
   Kit and Waters Ward Alderman Brian O’Gallagher, Ms Worden said that a
   permanent police presence has been trialled previously at Palmerston,
   Parap and Casuarina shopping precincts.

   “They were proven to be an uneconomical, ineffective, and costly
   alternative to responsive mobile patrols,” she wrote in the letter that
   was shared on social media.

   “Additionally, use of a police caravan has also been trialled earlier
   at Karama, with results showing that police response, as required, with
   regular proactive patrols was a more appropriate allocation of police
   resources.”

   Ms Worden added that “a review of incidents reported throughout 2022
   from the Karama Shopping Centre indicates a decrease over the last 12
   months, while other suburbs in the response area show an equal demand
   on policing resources”.

   Ms Ah Kit said she had been calling for more than half a decade for a
   permanent police presence in the Karama area to deal with
   out-of-control crime. The petition had gained 1,168 signatories.

   To augment the lack of police presence in Karama, Ms Ah Kit has
   supported the funding of Neptune NT—a private security company—to do
   nightly dog patrols in Karama and the nearby suburb of Malak.

   However, Ms Worden has previously voiced her disapproval of the
   security patrols, suggesting they do not stop crime, only move it to a
   different neighbourhood.

   The recently announced Karama security patrols cost the NT Government
   around $250,000, which Mr O’Gallagher said could reach $1 million per
   year if continued.

   That amount would be better spent on delivering more police officers in
   Karama, he said.

   “Nothing is more effective in deterring crime than officers in blue
   uniforms being very visible and engaging our community at our shopping
   centres and patrolling our streets,” he said.

     “The Minister claims that the number of incidents in Karama has
     reduced over the last 12 months. Certainly, this doesn’t reflect the
     feedback I get from residents—and possibly residents have stopped
     reporting incidents because they see no action taken.”

   The Nightcliff Police Station is roughly 9 km from the Karama Shopping
   Plaza, but is staffed by 35 police officers instead of the required 70,
   while the Casuarina Police station is just 4km from Karama. Both
   stations serve the Karama area populated by around 4,800 residents.

   Last week, Ms Worden announced a crime action plan for Alice Springs
   that involves bringing bureaucrats and non-government agencies together
   to help solve that town’s crime crisis. She said a similar program will
   be established in Darwin’s northern suburbs next.

   DALLAS (AP) — A woman accused of firing several gunshots inside a
   Dallas airport faces a charge of aggravated assault of a public servant
   because she allegedly fired one round toward a police officer,
   according to an arrest warrant.

       direction
     __________________________________________________________________

   The officer shot and wounded Portia Odufuwa, who was taken to a
   hospital after Monday's shooting at Dallas’ Love Field Airport.

   Odufuwa, who had no luggage, entered the ticketing area, then went into
   a restroom, emerging with her hands in the pockets of a hooded
   sweatshirt, according to the arrest warrant. She then went toward a
   ticket counter and witnesses reported hearing a disturbance before she
   shouted, “I'm going to blow this (obscenity) up!” and pulled a handgun.

   She fired two rounds in the ceiling and as she was confronted by a
   police officer, she fired in his direction, the arrest warrant said.
   The officer was not struck.

   Police were set to give a Tuesday afternoon news conference on the
   shooting. Jail records do not list an attorney who is representing her
   on the charge.

   Dallas police Chief Eddie Garcia has said Odufuwa was shot in her
   “lower extremities.” He said no one else was injured.

   Airport operations at Love Field, one of the Dallas-Fort Worth-area's
   two major airports, were suspended for hours and dozens of flights were
   canceled.

   Authorities have not released a motive for the shooting, but Odufuwa
   has been arrested several times in recent years and has been found
   incompetent for trial more than once.

   A judge last year found her incompetent to stand trial after she was
   charged with making a false report, court records show. The judge found
   that she wasn’t a danger to others and referred her to outpatient
   mental health services.

   In that case, she was accused of pulling a fire alarm at a hotel after
   the clerk refused to extend her stay, The Dallas Morning News reported,
   citing police. Records show the charge was dismissed.

   In 2019, she was found incompetent to stand trial after she was accused
   of robbing a bank in the Dallas suburb of Wylie. She underwent
   treatment, and court records show the case was eventually dismissed.

   Also that year, she was arrested for arson after telling a police
   officer who had responded to a house fire in the Dallas suburb of
   Mesquite that she started it and was “God’s prophet,” according to a
   police report. She also told police she was married to singer Chris
   Brown, the police report said. The Dallas County district attorney’s
   office said that charge was rejected for lack of scientific evidence to
   support a conviction.

   On Monday at the airport, she also was heard making comments about
   Brown, according to the arrest warrant.

Informal settlement near Paris: 'Every morning, the police tell us to get
out'

   Roughly 300 migrants are camping out under the national highway in the
   Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis. Nearly every morning police officers
   order them to get out; and food distribution points keep getting pushed
   farther away from the heart of the French capital.

   There’s anger written on the faces of the the men who have been living
   in a camp under the A1 highway bridge in the northern Parisian suburb
   of Saint-Denis.

   This morning, as happens every morning, the police arrived around 6 am
   and ordered the migrants installed on the esplanade in front of the
   tricolor "UEFA Euro 2016" poster to "get out". Only the tents,
   installed on the dirt slope between the road and the esplanade, are
   allowed to stay.

   Surrounded by highways and major city thoroughfares, the camp has no
   benches to sit on, no toilets, and only one water point for about 300
   people. A single wooden chair has been placed in the middle of the
   camp, but no one seems to risk sitting on it.

   Distributions further and further away

   The camp right now has about 200 small tents, and every day, new ones
   are added. Volunteers from the French NGO Utopia 56 regularly visit the
   camp, which is inhabited by single men mostly hailing from Afghanistan.

   friend Credit InfoMigrants By late morning, there are only about 50
   people in the camp. The others have left to get something to eat or to
   try to find a way to contact the Office of Integration and Immigration
   (Ofii) whose single phone line for asylum seekers is unreachable this
   morning.

   The further the migrant camps are from Paris, the more difficult it
   gets for people living there to access food and clothing distributions.
   From the Saint-Denis camp, migrants have to take the metro or walk
   almost an hour to reach the Saint-Ouen gate where the Salvation Army
   has moved its breakfast distribution since August 24.

   Breakfasts with access to information

   Breakfasts are an opportunity to fill stomachs and get hot beverages –
   and also to enjoy the small comforts of tables and benches set up next
   to the distribution stand. Asylum seekers can also take stock of their
   situation with France Terre d'Asile, a migrant rights NGO, which has
   installed a mobile truck a little further away. Some members of Utopia
   56 are also present to answer questions.

   Gulkhan, 25, and Taher, 16, look a little lost. The two friends from
   Afghanistan arrived from Germany the day before and were directed to
   the Saint-Denis camp by a friend of a friend. Utopia 56 explains to
   them that Taher has to go for an evaluation in order to assert his
   minority status and be taken into the care of the Children's Welfare
   Agency (ASE). The teenager with thick black curls and most of his face
   hidden behind a mask does not seem to believe it.

   Tonight, he will probably spend another night in the Saint-Denis camp
   with Gulkhan. Like all those unable to get a tent, the two Afghans will
   instead lie on a simple blanket on the ground next to the tents.

   They are the ones the police try to evacuate every morning. Sometimes,
   the operation is muscular. Khan, a 23-year-old Afghan dressed in a
   military camouflage-print outfit, says that a week earlier, the police
   used tear gas to dislodge migrants here.

   Safety fears

   "The hardest part is that the police come every morning and tell us to
   get out," he says. "Sometimes, outside people also come and attack us
   or pick fights to steal our phones," he says. To try to protect
   themselves, the migrants in the camp now organize guard tours. Khan 23
   has been living on the streets for more than a year Credit InfoMigrants
   Khan has been living in the camp for about a month after police on July
   29 evacuated a sprawling camp in the northern Parisian suburb of
   Aubervilliers. Having been denied asylum, Khan filed an appeal before
   the National Asylum Court (CNDA).

   The Saint-Denis camp also includes newcomers and "Dublinés" (after the
   Dublin Regulation that determines asylum applications in the EU) who
   have spent months, even years, crisscrossing Europe in search of
   international protection that no country wants to grant them.

   'Afghanistan is sinking, we have to flee'

   When asked why they left home, many Afghans invariably have the same
   reaction: a slow, pained smile followed by an intake of breath before
   offering a simple explanation, as one migrant who declined to be
   identified put it: "Afghanistan is sinking, we have to flee".

   Migrant aid associations regularly denounce the living conditions in
   the camps north of Paris and call for permanent accommodation solutions
   for asylum seekers.

   "The street is a school of madness as well as indignity," warned Pierre
   Henry, director general of France Terre d'Asile, in a recent interview
   with InfoMigrants.

   "We're waiting for the public authorities to think about a long-term
   solution," said Pierre Jothy, a social worker with Utopia 56, "If the
   only presence of the state for them is the police, who are always
   pushing them further away, that's not acceptable."

   So far, the state's response has been to dismantle migrant camps with
   police pushing migrants further away from Paris and deeper into the
   suburbs. Evacuations follow one after the other, and the camps are
   re-formed. The camp at Saint-Denis under the A1 highway is likely to be
   no exception.

A neighborhood’s new anti-Section 8 rules will push many Black residents out
of a North Texas suburb

   Landlords in Texas don’t have to accept renters who receive federal
   housing assistance, but a Denton County community is taking it a big
   step further: making most of the town off limits to Section 8 tenants.

   PROVIDENCE VILLAGE — By the time Revisha Threats moved into a two-story
   home in this North Texas hamlet last year, she had filled out more than
   100 applications to find a home for her and her four children.

   Threats, 31, said she wanted a home “somewhere good and humble for my
   kids” as she tried to escape an abusive relationship in Atlanta. She
   considered joining her sister in California but worried she couldn’t
   afford that state’s high rents, even with help through the federal
   housing choice voucher program, widely referred to as Section 8, that
   subsidizes a portion of a low-income household’s rent.

   Then Threats’ sister turned her attention to the suburbs north of
   Dallas and Fort Worth. The rent was affordable, and according to her
   sister’s research, crime was low. Threats said she applied to live in
   more than 100 houses and apartments, but none would accept her. Texas
   is one of the few states that allows landlords to reject renters if
   they receive housing vouchers.

   Finally, Threats found a landlord in Providence Village, a town of
   about 7,700 people less than an hour’s drive north of Dallas, who
   accepted vouchers — and she and her kids left Atlanta with four
   suitcases, bound for Texas.

   Threats said she fell in love with Providence Village. She started a
   business cleaning neighbors’ homes. Her kids were happy. Her daughter
   had been withdrawn since her father died in 2015, and retreated even
   further from friends during the pandemic. But in Providence Village,
   she “opened up,” Threats said.

   “I was at peace, I was happy,” Threats said. “The neighbors, they
   treated us like family.”

   But after less than a year, Threats and her family must once more pack
   their bags and move elsewhere.

   In the months after Threats moved in, homeowners began to turn against
   the neighborhood’s Section 8 renters — who are predominantly Black. In
   private Facebook groups, they increasingly blamed tenants for a
   perceived uptick in criminal activity in Providence Village.

   The wave of anti-Section 8 sentiment peaked in June, when the
   Providence Homeowners Association’s board passed a rule effectively
   banning Section 8 renters from living in the neighborhood — a move that
   will displace more than 150 families from the majority-white enclave.

   Black families make up 93% of the 157 households with Section 8
   vouchers living in Providence Village, according to the Dallas and
   Denton housing authorities. Women head all but five of those
   households.

   Section 8 tenants have to leave Providence when their current leases
   end, according to the new rule. The homeowners association and the town
   are legally separate entities but share much of the same territory.
   That means within a year, an entire Texas town will mostly be off
   limits to voucher holders.

   Low-income housing advocates have blasted the ban as racial
   discrimination. Soon after the rule was on the books, a trio of
   advocacy groups — Texas Housers, Texas Homeless Network and United Way
   of Denton County — called on the U.S. Department of Justice to
   investigate whether the rule violated the federal Fair Housing Act.

   “This basically says that ‘there’ll be no Section 8 in our city,’” said
   Ann Lott, executive director of the Dallas-based Inclusive Communities
   Project. “So for years, we’ve had to deal with the homeowners saying
   ‘not in my neighborhood.’ But now we have a move afoot that says ‘not
   even in our city.’ That’s concerning.”

   There’s nothing in state or federal law that forbids homeowners
   associations from enacting such bans, legal experts say, although it’s
   unusual for HOAs to enact them. The Texas Tribune identified two other
   Dallas-Fort Worth-area homeowners associations that ban voucher
   holders.

   “I’ve literally read through thousands” of homeowners associations’
   rules, said Gregory Cagle, a lawyer who deals with HOA law. “It’s not
   common.”

   Providence HOA leaders have not publicly explained their rationale for
   the Section 8 ban, according to tenants, landlords and others who spoke
   with the Tribune. Officials with the HOA, including board President
   Jennifer Dautrich, and Providence Village Mayor Linda Inman did not
   return requests for comment.

   Families now are scrambling to find new places to live — and to do so
   before school starts. As Threats discovered, such housing can be
   difficult to find in Texas, where a 2015 state law essentially allows
   landlords to ban Section 8 recipients.

   A 2017 report by Inclusive Communities Project found that out of 1,900
   properties surveyed in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, only 226 accepted
   vouchers — predominantly in areas that are poor and Black. No apartment
   complex in 26 Dallas suburbs — nearly all majority-white — surveyed by
   the organization accepted vouchers, the survey found.

   “The lack of 150 homes available for voucher tenants is a very severe
   effect,” said Laura Beshara, a civil rights lawyer representing some of
   the Providence Village tenants. “The families are going to have a very
   hard time finding housing.”

   Advocates and tenants, however, worry that other homeowners
   associations will copy the Providence HOA and enact their own bans on
   renting to voucher holders.

“Your neighborhood’s too perfect”

   Huffines Communities — the Dallas real estate firm founded by Don
   Huffines, the former Republican state senator who unsuccessfully
   challenged Gov. Greg Abbott in this year’s GOP gubernatorial primary,
   and his brother Phillip — first began developing the neighborhood in
   2000.

   Providence “reflects the Huffines’ dedication to providing a lifestyle
   that embraces family traditions in their home and creates lasting
   memories,” the company’s website says.

   More than 5,000 people lived in the subdivision by 2010, according to
   the Denton Record-Chronicle. That year, residents voted to incorporate
   Providence Village as its own municipality.

   The neighborhood feels like a beachside resort, with large,
   white-trimmed houses and manicured lawns lining narrow, winding
   streets. The neighborhood is dotted with artificial lakes and features
   a water slide, pools and jogging trails.

   Nearly three-fourths of its residents are white, 17% are Hispanic and
   7% are Black.

   “Even when I have friends come over, they’re like, ‘Your neighborhood’s
   too perfect, you might need to just be careful,’” Threats said. “I
   never saw it coming, how ugly it was behind closed doors.”

   To Evette Townsend, the town has always been unwelcoming. She and her
   six children, who moved to Texas from Milwaukee in 2018, lived in
   nearby Paloma Creek until last year, when their landlord sold the
   house. Townsend wanted to stay in the same school district and managed
   to find a home in Providence Village.

   About a month after her family moved into their new home in December,
   Townsend’s 17-year-old son and two friends visiting from Frisco drove
   to 7-Eleven to pick up snacks for a movie night.

   Less than 10 minutes later, Townsend saw flashing police lights through
   the window. She ran outside to find a police officer with the Aubrey
   Police Department, which patrols Providence Village, pointing a stun
   gun at her son’s friends. The officer told Townsend that her son and
   his friends ran a stop sign and were driving recklessly through the
   neighborhood. Another told her they were speeding at 45 mph through an
   alley. At least six officers showed up to the scene.

   After that, police officers would “pop up” at her house for no apparent
   reason, Townsend said. Officers pulled her son over several times while
   he drove her black Chrysler 300 around town, she said. Townsend said an
   officer pulled her over once in the neighborhood for speeding in a
   school zone — and told her that her Chrysler was a “high-profile car.”
   As soon as school let out, Townsend’s son left for Milwaukee for the
   summer.

   “It looks like a nice neighborhood to live in,” Townsend said. “But we
   never got the welcome or never got a chance to experience any of that.”

“Only so many should be allowed”

   Providence Village residents and landlords — as well as lawyers and
   housing advocates who have become involved — trace the rising
   anti-Section 8 sentiment over the last year to last summer, when a
   14-year-old Black teenager stabbed a 16-year-old white teenager at a
   neighborhood basketball court.

   Word spread through the neighborhood that the teenager who was arrested
   was from a Section 8 household.

   Since then, according to renters who spoke to the Tribune, it’s become
   common for Section 8 tenants to be blamed online for anything that goes
   wrong in the neighborhood.

   In the wake of the basketball court stabbing, people in private
   Facebook groups geared toward Providence Village began to try to figure
   out how many Section 8 tenants lived in the HOA. At some point, a map
   of houses rented to Section 8 tenants circulated around the
   neighborhood.

   Eventually, residents in the groups began to discuss ways to get rid of
   Section 8 renters altogether — although HOA leaders at first seemed to
   reject the notion.

   Dautrich, now the HOA’s board president, wrote in one Facebook comment
   thread in October that she believed Section 8 “is a good resource but
   should have a timeline and only so many should be allowed in any
   neighborhood,” according to screenshots in videos posted on Threats’
   TikTok account. Still, lawyers told HOA board members “there is nothing
   we can do” about landlords renting to Section 8 tenants in the
   neighborhood, Dautrich wrote.

   By June, that thinking had changed. The HOA board first passed a rule
   to fine landlords $300 a week if they rent to Section 8 voucher holders
   — a move that drew applause at a June 6 public meeting.

   Landlords with several properties in Providence Village fretted about
   how they would bear the brunt of an additional $1,200 a month per
   tenant.

   After an outcry from tenants and housing advocates, as well as local
   media attention — including multiple stories by the Denton
   Record-Chronicle — the association changed direction and delayed
   enforcement of the new rule. Tenants who signed a 12-month lease before
   the rule went into effect can stay on through the end of the lease.
   Those on a month-to-month lease can stay until mid-September. After
   that, landlords must pay the fine if they rent to Section 8 tenants.

   Because the Section 8 ban overwhelmingly affects Black residents, it
   likely violates the federal Fair Housing Act, which explicitly
   prohibits discrimination based on race, said Beshara and Mike Daniel,
   the lawyers representing Providence Village tenants.

   “That’s pretty functionally equivalent to being able to say, ‘You’re
   Black, get out,’” Daniel said of the ban.

“We want what’s best for our families”

   The Section 8 ban is part of a broader package of rules passed by the
   HOA board aimed at discouraging real estate investors from buying homes
   in the neighborhood and turning them into rentals.

   Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and historically low interest rates,
   investors and corporations — often referred to as “institutional
   buyers” — began buying more homes with the intent of renting them out
   or flipping them.

   Last year, Texas was the top target in the nation for investors. Home
   purchases made by investors accounted for 28% of all home purchases in
   the state in 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors —
   a higher percentage than in any other state. In Denton County, where
   Providence Village is, that figure was 39%.

   Under the new rules, a new homeowner must live in their home for two
   years before they can rent it to a tenant — and a lease has to last
   longer than 90 days. A landlord can own only one rental home at a time.

   Jenny Hersey, a mortgage underwriter who moved to Providence Village in
   2008, supported the rules package out of worry that investor activity
   would make the neighborhood unaffordable, she said.

   Hersey said she empathizes with voucher holders who will have to find a
   new place to live but noted that the HOA is letting tenants stay
   through the end of their leases — and that housing authorities are
   helping tenants relocate.

   “I don’t want to say I’m in support of the Section 8 ban — I’m in
   support of the overall rental restrictions and the fact that our
   neighborhood needed those and something needed to be implemented,” she
   said, adding that the homeowners elected HOA officers to do what’s best
   for the community.

   “They’ve got families here as well. So we’re all in this together as we
   want what’s best for our neighborhood, we want what’s best for our
   families,” she said.

   Two other homeowners associations developed by Huffines Communities
   have enacted similar bans — Savannah HOA, also in Denton County, and
   Heartland Community Association in Kaufman County, about half an hour
   east of Dallas.

   While in the state Senate, Don Huffines made it easier for landlords
   not to rent to voucher holders. In 2015, he backed a bill that
   prohibited cities and counties from forbidding landlords from refusing
   to tenants who receive Section 8 assistance — a pushback to attempts by
   local officials in Austin and Dallas to do so. Abbott signed the bill
   into law.

   Don Huffines directed a Tribune reporter’s request for comment to a
   spokesperson. His brother Phillip, co-owner and co-founder of Huffines
   Communities, said the company sold the last lots at Providence a decade
   ago and is no longer involved in the development. The decision to ban
   Section 8 tenants is up to each homeowners association, he said.

   “They decide, that’s up to them,” Phillip Huffines said. “That has
   nothing to do with us.”

“They want their neighborhood back”

   Many tenants aren’t sticking around as they try to get into new homes
   by the beginning of the school year. One landlord who asked not to be
   identified because they still own several properties in the
   neighborhood and fear harassment said some of their tenants have
   already relocated.

   Threats said she thought she would stay in the neighborhood longer —
   but she said the situation has taken a toll on her mental health. Her
   cleaning business fell apart after one client falsely alleged on social
   media that Threats had charged her twice for one cleaning, Threats
   said. The woman later apologized, she said, but the damage was done.

   At one point, neighbors found a news article detailing Threats’ 2019
   arrest on charges of credit card fraud in Alabama — featuring her
   mugshot — and shared it in one of the neighborhood Facebook groups.

   In late June, she started buying moving boxes and looking for a new
   home. Her landlord had one available in Dallas, where she plans to
   rebuild the cleaning business.

   “I know that I’m supposed to be excited and happy,” Threats said. “I
   am, but a part of me is still heartbroken.”

   Evora Sykes moved to Texas from Arkansas with her two children four
   years ago seeking opportunity, landing in Providence Village in 2018.
   She worked as a shuttle driver at Dallas-Fort Worth International
   Airport until September, when she caught COVID-19.

   Sykes planned to move next year, but the ban changed her plans. On a
   day in late June, boxes and bags full of belongings lined the hallway
   of her two-story home. On the front porch, Sykes had put out pillows,
   plates, towels and other household items for sale.

   Days after the ban took effect, Sykes hosted a cookout with Townsend
   and Threats at her house, hoping to blow off some steam.

   It didn’t take long for tensions to flare again. Sykes’ neighbor — who
   had recently trolled Sykes and Threats in a Facebook post — began
   taking photos of the cars parked outside her home. When Threats
   confronted the neighbor, a shouting match erupted — prompting the
   police to show up and ticket both Threats and the neighbor.

   Sitting in Sykes’ garage — out of view from hostile neighbors — Sykes
   and Townsend shared their plans. Townsend is moving closer to Fort
   Worth. Sykes is moving elsewhere in the D-FW area but won’t say where,
   fearing that harassment will follow her.

   “They claim they want their neighborhood back,” Sykes said. “That’s
   what some of us are doing. We’re in the process of giving them their
   neighborhood back.”

   Mass shootingAn 'idyllic suburban Jewish capital'

What you need to know about Highland Park, the Chicago suburb rattled by July
4 shooting

According to a 2020 study of the metropolitan Chicago area by researchers at
Brandeis University and the University of Chicago, Highland Park is 50%
Jewish.

   (JTA) — In 2014, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency included Highland Park
   in an article on communities across the country that were melding
   Jewish pride into their ceremonies for July 4, which that year fell on
   Friday, just before Shabbat.

   Locals were used to seeing a 1953 pickup truck drive through their
   suburb and others along Chicago’s North Shore blaring a mashup of the
   song “Yankee Doodle Boy” with a niggun, or wordless melody, written by
   the noted Orthodox singer-songwriter Shlomo Carlebach.

   The director of a local synagogue said he passed out both American and
   Israeli flags along the North Shore parade route. “In Highland Park,”
   he told JTA, “they prefer the Israeli flag.”

   The report captures Highland Park’s sky-high levels of Jewish pride and
   provides yet another example of how Monday’s shooting that killed at
   least seven people at a July 4 parade there struck the heart of one of
   the country’s idyllic suburban Jewish capitals. (One of the two victims
   identified so far, Jacki Sundheim, was the b’nei mitzvah and event
   coordinator for the North Shore Congregation Israel in the neighboring
   suburb of Glencoe.)

   The entire North Shore region — which stretches over 20 miles along
   Lake Michigan, approximately from Evanston up to Lake Bluff — is
   heavily Jewish, and other adjacent suburbs northwest of Chicago, such
   as Buffalo Grove and Skokie, are also known for their large Jewish
   populations. But Highland Park has the highest Jewish ratio of them
   all, and it was the original Chicago suburb that grew a substantial
   Jewish population in the early 20th century.

A Chicago area ‘Jerusalem’

   According to a 2020 study of the metropolitan Chicago area by
   researchers at Brandeis University and the University of Chicago,
   Highland Park is 50% Jewish: about 15,000 of the suburb’s 30,000
   residents. (About 3% of the Jews in Highland Park and its surrounding
   towns are Israeli, the study also found.)

   Thanks to its leading number of Jewish institutions — from camps to
   synagogues to a kosher butcher and other kosher restaurants — Highland
   Park is also still a destination for Jews throughout the North Shore,
   said Jay Tcath, executive vice president of Chicago’s Jewish United
   Fund federation.

   “While there are other Jewish concentrations elsewhere in the North
   Shore, Highland Park’s still the original. Highland Park is kind of
   still the Mecca, or Jerusalem, if you will,” Tcath said.

   Highland Park’s Jewish history dates back to the turn of the 20th
   century, when Tcath said Jewish families began spending parts of their
   summers in the area. The Lake Shore Country Club opened in 1908 as
   likely the only of its kind in the area to admit Jews in neighboring
   Glencoe, but Tcath said it was “primarily populated by [people from]
   Highland Park.” In 1918, the similar Northmoor Country Club opened in
   Highland Park proper.

   Some lamenting the tragedy on social media noted how the shooting
   punctured a very affluent, normally peaceful town where several iconic
   movies ostensibly about American suburbia — from “Ferris Bueller’s Day
   Off” to “Sixteen Candles” — were filmed. Highland Park’s median
   household income was $147,067 in 2020, according to the Census Bureau,
   more than twice the national median.

   “It’s a place of movie magic and one of the 100 wealthiest cities in
   America,” tweeted the noted film critic Richard Roeper. “No place is
   safe.”

Hockey bagels and other antisemitism

   The town has avoided large-scale antisemitic incidents throughout the
   20th century — even as nearby Skokie became the site of a nationwide
   neo-Nazi march and the center of a landmark Supreme Court case in the
   late 1970s, and as West Rogers Park on Chicago’s far northwest side saw
   a white supremacist shoot to kill multiple Orthodox Jews leaving
   services in 1999.

   Tcath said that the worst for Highland Park involved antisemitic hockey
   fans from neighboring towns, who in the 1980s and 90s would throw
   bagels onto the ice when their children played against Highland Park,
   to try to intimidate and embarrass them. In 2019, Highland Park High
   School yearbooks had to be edited to remove Nazi and white supremacist
   elements from multiple students’ comments. This past April, around the
   Yom HaShoah Holocaust Remembrance Day, antisemitic flyers were found
   scattered throughout Highland Park and other North Shore communities
   (they shared qualities with others distributed in several other cities
   over the past year by the antisemitic Goyim Defense League group).

Famous Highland Park Jews

   Highland Park’s Jewish population is comparable to Squirrel Hill, the
   Pittsburgh neighborhood where a white supremacist opened fire on the
   Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, killing 11 Jewish worshippers. Like
   Squirrel Hill — which is also home to almost exactly 15,000 Jews —
   Highland Park boasts an array of synagogues spanning denominations,
   including multiple Reform congregations and the largest
   Chabad-Lubavitch center in the area, called the Central Avenue
   Synagogue.

   It has also been the hometown for several famous Jews, from “Butch
   Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” screenwriter William Goldman to Olympic
   figure skater Jason Brown. (The non-Jewish Rachel Brosnahan, who is not
   Jewish but has said her upbringing around Jewish friends helped inform
   her performance as the very Jewish comedian Midge Maisel in the
   Emmy-winning Amazon TV series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” also hails
   from Highland Park.) Several Highland Park mayors, including the
   incumbent Nancy Rotering, have been Jewish.

   The town is rich in other 20th-century Jewish history, too. In 1967,
   Highland Park’s Congregation Solel flew a delegation into Washington,
   D.C., to protest the Vietnam War in what a JTA dispatch from the time
   called a historic move for an American congregation of any faith.
   Highland Park synagogue-goers were also active in the movement to free
   Soviet Jewry in the 1970s and 80s. Congregation Solel was led for a
   decade by Rabbi Robert Marx, a pioneering social justice activist who
   marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. and died last year at 93.

   While the Squirrel Hill shooter’s motive was clear, local police are
   still investigating the alleged Highland Park attacker, Robert “Bobby”
   Crimo III. Crimo’s father, Bob Crimo II, is a well-known local figure
   who owns multiple businesses, including a deli, and once unsuccessfully
   ran for mayor.

   Tcath said that while his organization and so many others are still
   looking into the younger Crimo’s background, Highland Park’s Jews are
   not reacting first with fears about a looming wave of specifically
   antisemitic violence. The town is heavily Democratic, and the fact that
   the incident was another of the 300-plus mass shootings in the United
   States so far in 2022 has many talking about gun reform.

   “People are shaken, but they’re not processing it as I was, or I am
   more at risk, because I live in Highland Park in particular,” Tcath
   said. “It’s being processed as, ‘This is yet another example of what
   America is today.’” PJC

Rally for justice in Chicago suburb after young woman killed by police

   Dave Power and Don GrossAugust 10, 2021
   523 4 minutes read

   On August 5, officials in the Chicago suburb of Dolton acquiesced to
   some of the demands of family and community activists calling for
   justice after the police killing of Alexis Wilson. Officials released
   some body camera footage of the killing of Wilson from early morning
   July 28. The Mayor of Dolton, Tiffany Henyard, also apologized and
   walked back a previous statement where she praised the actions of
   police that led to Wilson’s death.

   This reversal on the part of Dolton police happened because of protest.
   On August 2, family members and community activists mobilized to demand
   justice for Wilson, a 19-year-old woman who was killed by police days
   earlier. The action began outside the house of Henyard, where more than
   20 police officers from multiple agencies confronted the crowd.

   The lack of transparency from Dolton officials and police leaves many
   questions around the circumstances of Wilson’s killing. Wilson was at
   the local fast food restaurant Baba’s around 1 a.m. on July 27 when
   police arrived. Not long after, she was dead and her car had crashed
   into a building down the street from where the incident began.

   The day after the killing, Sean Howard, a spokesperson for Dolton, gave
   an interview with Fox 32 News where he repeatedly described the car
   Wilson was in as a deadly weapon.

   In the aftermath of the shooting, Dolton officials appeared more
   concerned with justifying the actions of police than actually providing
   the public or Wilson’s family with accurate information about the
   incident. At the time of this writing almost two weeks after the event,
   the names of the officers involved, including the shooter, have not
   been released.

   At a press conference the day after the killing, Mayor Henyard said of
   Dolton police: “They did do the right thing. If anything, they have
   saved the community from any crime that could have or would have
   happened last night.”

   Mayor Henyard’s words were criticized multiple times by organizers that
   gathered outside her house on August 2. They noted that the Mayor’s
   statement came well before any investigation had been completed and
   even before officials had spoken to Wilson’s family.

   Dr. La’Shawn Littrice of Make Noize for Change stated: “To not be able
   to offer your condolences to the family is a slap in the face. This
   family has not received one phone call or visit from this mayor. Nor
   has she come out to retract or correct her statement so we need an
   apology for that. What we also need is justice for the family. We want
   charges to be brought up on these officers and we want them to be
   convicted.”

   The mayor initially did not meet with protesters or offer an apology to
   the family. Instead, dozens of armed police officers from multiple
   departments arrived in front of her home to intimidate protesters. At
   least one of these officers was carrying an assault-style rifle. These
   confrontational tactics are emblematic of the aggressive style of
   policing in Cook County, especially the predominantly Black and Latino
   suburbs south of the city.

   Miracle Boyd, a youth organizer with Good Kids Mad City, expanded how
   police treat oppressed communities: “Times like these happen all the
   time and they’re always going to criminalize our Black and Brown youth.
   Black and Brown women and men in this country are not protected.”

   Just days after the protest, the tone from Dolton officials changed.
   Mayor Henyard issued an apology saying: “The words that I expressed
   previously were based upon the information at the time and were not
   meant to overshadow the significance of Ms. Wilson’s life, nor cause
   additional pain to the Wilson family.” The police chief also screened a
   video of Wilson’s killing that used body camera and surveillance
   footage from the incident, and framed the incident as a tragedy for all
   involved.

   The footage released shows Wilson’s car in the drive-through with an
   officer leaning through the front-passenger window before the car moves
   and leaves the frame. Alexis Wilson is heard in the footage several
   times saying that she does not want to leave the car because she was
   naked, wearing only a robe and top. Police begin reaching into her car,
   and it appears that a police officer strikes her before her car moves.

   After the partial body camera footage was released, the family gathered
   to give their own press conference. They spoke about how they got more
   information about the death of Wilson from the local news media than
   from the police. They called for police to release unedited footage
   from the body cameras. Alonzo Wilson, the father of Alexis, said: “I do
   want justice, and I want the lies to stop.”

   Organizer Joseph Wilson said: “We are here today because of the murder
   of Alexis Wilson by Dolton police.” He urged people to “come out here
   to make sure Dolton police and the Dolton mayor are held accountable
   for their actions.”

   In the context of extreme police impunity in the south suburbs of
   Chicago, the release of body camera footage and an apology from the
   mayor is a victory in the movement for justice for Wilson and all
   victims of police terror. The Better Government Association found that
   between 2005 and 2020 there were at least 135 police shootings in the
   suburbs surrounding Chicago, and not a single officer was charged or
   even disciplined. Dolton itself accounted for nine of these shootings.
   The struggle for justice for Alexis Wilson will continue.

   French authorities have detained three people and opened a terrorism
   investigation after a man attacked and killed a police administrator
   Friday with a knife at a police station in a Paris suburb.

   Security officials said the attacker stabbed a female police
   administrative worker outside the police station in the southwest Paris
   suburb of Rambouillet.

   The officials said at least one police officer at the scene opened fire
   on the assailant — identified as a 36-year-old Tunisian national living
   in France — and fatally shot him. Media reporters said the man had no
   previous criminal record and was unknown to police.

   Authorities say the victim was a 49-year-old female police
   administrator, who was returning to work after her lunch break, when
   she was attacked and stabbed in the throat. Witnesses say the attacker
   shouted “Allah Akbar” — “God is great” — as he stabbed her.

   French Prime Minister Jean Castex, along with other officials, was at
   the scene of the crime in Rambouillet, an upscale suburb about 60
   kilometers southwest of Paris in France’s Yvelines department. Castex,
   and France's antiterror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard, who also was
   at the scene, said the incident would be investigated as a terrorist
   attack.

   On his Twitter account, French President Emmanuel Macron said the
   nation is at the side of the slain police administrator, her family,
   colleagues and the police. “In the fight against Islamist terrorism, we
   will not give up.”

   The attack comes six months after another knife attack in the region
   when an Islamist teenager beheaded a schoolteacher in Conflans, another
   town outside Paris.
   France has suffered a wave of attacks by Islamist militants or
   Islamist-inspired individuals in recent years that have killed about
   250 people.

Many U.S. states barely use red flag laws as shootings and gun deaths soar

   Chicago is one of the nation’s gun violence hotspots and a seemingly
   ideal place to employ Illinois’ “red flag” law that allows police to
   step in and take firearms away from people who threaten to kill. But
   amid more than 8,500 shootings resulting in 1,800 deaths since 2020,
   the law was used there only four times.

   It’s a pattern that’s played out in New Mexico, with nearly 600 gun
   homicides during that period and a mere eight uses of its red flag law.
   And in Massachusetts, with nearly 300 shooting homicides and just 12
   uses of its law.

   An Associated Press analysis found many U.S. states barely use the red
   flag laws touted as the most powerful tool to stop gun violence before
   it happens, a trend blamed on a lack of awareness of the laws and
   resistance by some authorities to enforce them even as shootings and
   gun deaths soar.

   AP found such laws in 19 states and the District of Columbia were used
   to remove firearms from people 15,049 times since 2020, fewer than 10
   per 100,000 adult residents. Experts called that woefully low and not
   nearly enough to make a dent in gun violence, considering the millions
   of firearms in circulation and countless potential warning signs law
   enforcement officers encounter from gun owners every day.

   California

California enacts sweeping gun control laws, setting up a legal showdown

   Newsom signs several new gun restrictions into law, just weeks after
   the Supreme Court bolstered the rights of firearms owners.

   “It’s too small a pebble to make a ripple,” Duke University sociologist
   Jeffrey Swanson, who has studied red flag gun surrender orders across
   the nation, said of the AP tally. “It’s as if the law doesn’t exist.”

   “The number of people we are catching with red flags is likely
   infinitesimal,” added Indiana University law professor Jody Madeira,
   who like other experts who reviewed AP’s findings wouldn’t speculate
   how many red flag removal orders would be necessary to make a
   difference.

   The search for solutions comes amid a string of mass shootings in
   Buffalo, N.Y.; Uvalde, Texas; and Highland Park, Ill., and a spike in
   gun violence not seen in decades: 27,000 deaths so far this year,
   following 45,000 deaths each of the past two years.

   AP’s count, compiled from inquiries and Freedom of Information Law
   requests, showed wide disparities in how the laws were applied from
   state to state, county to county, most without regard to population or
   crime rates.

   Florida led with 5,800 such orders, or 34 per 100,000 adult residents,
   but that is due mostly to aggressive enforcement in a few counties that
   don’t include Miami-Dade and others with more gun killings. More than a
   quarter of Illinois’ slim 154 orders came from one suburban county that
   makes up just 7% of the state’s population. California had 3,197 orders
   but was working through a backlog of three times that number of people
   barred from owning guns under a variety of measures who had not yet
   surrendered them.

   And a national movement among politicians and sheriffs that has
   declared nearly 2,000 counties as “Second Amendment Sanctuaries,”
   opposing laws that infringe on gun rights, may have affected red flag
   enforcement in several states. In Colorado, 37 counties that consider
   themselves “sanctuaries” issued just 45 surrender orders in the two
   years through last year, a fifth less than non-sanctuary counties did
   per resident. New Mexico and Nevada reported only about 20 orders
   combined.

   “The law shouldn’t even be there in the first place,” argued Richard
   Mack, a former Arizona sheriff who heads the pro-gun Constitutional
   Sheriffs and Peace Officers Assn. “You’re taking away someone’s
   property and means of self-defense.”

   Red flag laws, most of which came into effect over the last four years,
   allow police officers who believe gun owners are an imminent danger to
   themselves or others to petition a judge to order firearms surrendered
   or, barring that, seized for an “emergency” period, typically two
   weeks. The judge can then convene a court hearing in which petitioners
   present evidence to withhold weapons longer, typically a year, and the
   owner can argue against that.

   Politics

Why a California Democrat’s ‘red flag’ gun proposal might become law

   A red-flag provision within the House legislation that passed Thursday
   stands out as perhaps the only piece that could pass the Senate.

   AP’s tally counts an emergency order that is followed by a longer one
   as a single order if they involve the same gun owner. In rare cases
   where no one asked for an emergency order and only a longer one was
   requested and granted, that also counts as a single order. Several
   states reported incomplete data.

   Some states also allow family members of gun owners, school officials,
   work colleagues or doctors to ask for gun removal orders, also known as
   extreme risk protection orders. But data reviewed by the AP show nearly
   all petitions in several states were initiated by police, possibly
   because, as several surveys have shown, few people outside law
   enforcement are even aware the laws exist.

   The recent spike in shootings has brought renewed attention to red flag
   laws, with states including Alaska, Pennsylvania and Kentucky
   introducing legislation to add them. The Biden administration is
   seeking to foster wider use of red flag laws by allocating money in a
   newly passed federal gun law to help spread the word about such
   measures.

   An AP-NORC poll in late July found 78% of U.S. adults strongly or
   somewhat favor red flag laws, but the backlash against them has been
   intense in some states, particularly in rural areas. Opponents argue
   that allowing judges to rule on gun seizures in initial emergency
   petitions before full hearings violates due process rights, though
   court cases claiming this have generally found the laws constitutional.

   Politics

Biden signs landmark bipartisan gun measure, says ‘lives will be saved’

   The law will toughen background checks for the youngest gun buyers,
   keep firearms from more domestic violence offenders and help put in
   place red flag laws.

   Many police believe seizing guns can also be dangerous and unnecessary,
   even as a last resort, especially in sparsely populated areas where
   they know many of the residents with mental health issues, said Tony
   Mace, head of the New Mexico Sheriffs’ Assn., which lobbied against the
   state’s law.

   “You’re showing up with 10 to 15 law enforcement officers and coming in
   the middle of the night and kicking in the door, and it’s already a
   dangerous environment,” said Mace, sheriff of Cibola County, a
   sanctuary county with just one order since 2020. “You’re dealing with
   someone in crisis and elevating it even more.”

   One fierce gun rights defender who still aggressively uses the law is
   Polk County, Fla., Sheriff Grady Judd, who says he doesn’t let his
   beliefs stand in the way of moving fast when gun owners threaten
   violence.

   “We’re not going to wait for an Uvalde, Texas, or a Parkland or a
   Columbine if we have the information and people say that they’re going
   to shoot or kill,” said Judd, who enforced 752 orders since 2020 in a
   county of 725,000 residents, a tally that’s more than the total orders
   for 15 entire states. “We’re going to use the tools that the state gave
   us.”

   Florida’s traditionally pro-gun Republican-led legislature passed its
   red flag law in 2018 following revelations police failed to act on
   repeated threats by an expelled student who would go on to carry out
   the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland
   earlier that year that left 17 people dead.

   A recent high-profile example of a red flag law not being used was for
   the 21-year-old gunman accused of fatally shooting seven people and
   injuring dozens more at a Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb
   of Highland Park. Robert E. Crimo III drew police attention three years
   earlier when he threatened to “kill everyone” in his house and officers
   acknowledged going to the home several times previously because of a
   “history of attempts” to take his own life.

How July 4 parade shooting suspect slipped through system

   Illinois’ ‘red-flag’ law could have stopped the suspect in the July 4
   parade shooting from buying a gun or at least delayed the purchase of a
   weapon.

   But Highland Park police never requested a gun surrender order, saying
   there was no gun belonging to Crimo to take away at the time, even
   though the law has a provision to block threatening people from making
   future purchases too.

   Illinois state Rep. Denyse Stoneback said there has clearly been a
   problem with awareness of the law among those tasked with carrying it
   out. “We’d go to police departments and they didn’t know anything about
   it,” said the Democrat who helped push through a bill last year
   providing $1 million in police red flag law training.

   Asked why Chicago had so few red flag firearm restraining orders,
   police spokesman Thomas Ahern said many of the city’s gun killings are
   committed with illegally owned firearms.

   struggled this week to process not one, but multiple high-profile
   shootings that unfolded in major cities and smaller towns across the
   U.S. But behind the stand-out headlines about shooting rampages in
   Bend, Ore., Phoenix, Detroit and Houston were dozens of murders and
   violent crimes that went largely unnoticed. (Megan Mendoza/The Arizona

‘Devastating’: Mass shootings obscure the daily U.S. gun toll

   Four high-profile shootings in U.S. cities this week drew headlines but
   masked the daily toll of gun violence in some of the same communities.

   But Ahern emphasized it remained a priority of the department to
   increase its awareness and use of the red flag law. “If we are able to
   prevent one citizen from getting hurt or killed that’s a law worth
   having and definitely not a low priority,” he said.

   In New York, a red flag-type situation that wasn’t covered under the
   state’s law nonetheless led to a spike in red flag gun surrender
   orders.

   Payton Gendron was a 17-year-old high school senior last year when he
   was investigated by New York’s State Police and ordered hospitalized
   for a mental health evaluation for typing into an economics class
   online program that his future plans included “murder-suicide.” But
   since he was a minor, he wasn’t covered under the state’s red flag law
   and it didn’t prevent him from later buying the high-powered rifle
   authorities say he used to kill 10 Black people in a racially motivated
   shooting at Buffalo supermarket in May.

   Since then, New York has seen 779 gun surrender orders under its red
   flag law, equal to nearly half of all its orders since the measure took
   effect three years ago.

   Several experts said it’s impossible to come up with an ideal number of
   red flag orders and misleading to compare states by orders because of
   the widely varying rates of gun ownership and gun homicides and
   suicides, among other stats.

   Another complicating factor is that some states have stricter gun
   ownerships rules and multiple ways to seize firearms. In California,
   for instance, guns can be taken away through domestic violence
   restraining orders, civil harassment protection orders and school
   violence prevention orders in addition to the red flag law.

   Still, experts consulted by AP agreed more could be done to enforce red
   flag laws given the prevalence of guns and the millions of gun owners
   that national studies suggest could be dangerous to themselves and
   others. In red flag states alone, figures compiled by the Gun Violence
   Archive show at least 21,100 homicides and 47,000 injuries during the
   2½ years covered by AP’s count.

   Several studies suggest red flag laws can be particularly effective in
   preventing gun suicides, which kill about 20,000 people a year. A Duke
   University study of Connecticut’s first-in-the-nation red flag law in
   1999 estimated that for every 10 to 20 surrender orders a life from a
   potential suicide was saved. A study of Indiana’s law came up with a
   similar ratio.

   While the impact of red flag laws on homicides is less well researched,
   studies suggest many mass shootings could be avoided if the laws were
   implemented aggressively. A study by the gun-control advocacy group
   Everytown for Gun Safety showed perpetrators exhibited dangerous
   warning signs before more than half of the mass shootings in the dozen
   years through 2020 that accounted for 596 deaths.

   Such warning signs have led to many opportunities to stop gun violence,
   as well as missed chances.

   In Colorado in 2020, police seized 59 guns from a man who complained of
   hit men coming to get him, bragged about shooting someone and
   repeatedly threatened his ex-wife.

   In New Jersey in 2019, police took seven guns from a man threatening on
   Facebook to attack a Walmart.

   And in Washington state in 2018, police removed 12 guns from the home
   of a man who posted on social media about killing Jews in a synagogue
   and kids in a school.

   None of those threatened shootings happened.

   But in Indianapolis in 2020, failure to employ all aspects of a red
   flag law resulted in disaster. After 18-year-old Brandon Hole’s mother
   alerted police that he was threatening to commit “suicide by cop,”
   police seized his pump-action shotgun. A county prosecutor could have
   gone further under the law to argue before a judge that Hole should be
   barred from possessing or buying a gun, but that never happened.

   A few months later, Hole bought two AR-style rifles at a gun store,
   turning to his mother and saying, “They don’t have a flag on me.”
   Several months after that, he fatally shot eight employees in a FedEx
   warehouse where he had worked and injured seven more before killing
   himself.

   “I feel the state of Indiana is an accessory to murder,” a wounded
   Angela Hughley told the Indianapolis Star shortly after the shooting.

   Amber Clark, a librarian in Sacramento might still be alive today if
   police had acted on a tip that Ronald Seay was armed and dangerous.

   The gunman’s twin brother called police in 2018 warning that Seay, who
   had a history of mental illness and trouble with police, was making
   violent threats and had two semiautomatic pistols. But the police never
   went to a judge to ask for a gun surrender order or tell the sibling
   that he could do that himself.

   A few weeks later, Seay unloaded 11 bullets into Clark’s face, head and
   body at pointblank range outside the Sacramento library.

   “It is obvious to me and my family that the application of California’s
   red flag law in this case would have saved two lives — Amber’s and the
   shooter’s — and prevented immeasurable grief,” said her husband, Kelly
   Clark. “My wife would still be alive and the killer would have received
   the help he needed instead of being condemned to life in prison.”

   while displaying a firearm. As the subjects who were confronted left
   the parking lot, the suspect shot the firearm in the direction of the
   vehicle. No one was injured as a result of the shooting, and there was
   no property damage reported. Ramone G. Tucker, 34, of Montgomery
   Alabama, was transported to the Bothwell Regional Health Center for a
   fit for confinement check. Tucker was cleared, then transported to the
   Pettis County Jail to be placed on a 24 hour hold pending charges of
   Unlawful Use of a Weapon, Armed Criminal Action, and Assault in the 1st
   Degree. Bond was not determined at the time of the report.

   of the report. Officers then took the original theft report, that a
   different male had entered the store and took two six packs of Corona
   bottles, valued at approximately $20.00. The male fled the store on
   foot after being confronted by employees.

Mexico City Suburb Fires 87 Officers Amid Corruption Charges

   Eighty-seven Naucalpan, Mexico, police officers are out of a job due to
   a corruption “purge” in that suburban municipality, the El Universal
   newspaper reported Tuesday.

   “This provision is implemented with strict adherence to the legal
   framework and full respect for human rights and the law and is based on
   a model for updating and modernizing the corporation to strengthen
   institutional capacities and implement strategies that improve security
   of the inhabitants,” Mayor Angelica Moya Marin told the newspaper, and
   also announced plans to recruit young people to join the force. "The
   aim is to recruit men and women with a vocation for service, who have
   training and professionalization schemes in order to maintain an
   environment of peace and tranquility in the municipality."

   According to the report, the officers were removed from their posts at
   the Municipal Preventative Police as a follow-up to Moya Marin’s
   anti-corruption and security program announced in June as “the first
   phase of the purge” for alleged crimes of extortion, robbery, and
   abuse.

   “Citizen complaints about corruption and abuses by municipal police are
   constant and for this reason we implement actions that allow us to
   combat the corruption of the police elements and promote honest
   conduct,” the mayor said.

   In June, she announced on her Facebook page several actions to battle
   the corruption, including the formation of a police anti-corruption
   unit, “neighborhood checkers,” development of an approved model of
   civic justice, police equipment and police academy monitoring to
   enhance security in the municipality.

   The report said that there were protests Monday regarding security in
   several of the city’s neighborhoods complaining about police abuses and
   asking for a change in personnel.

   [Police officers and commanders] only go to ask for money from shops
   and businesses in the area, but there is no security,” protestors told
   the news outlet.

   The municipality, formally called Naucalpan de Jurez, is one of 125
   suburban municipalities northwest of Mexico City with a population of
   about 800,000, according to Mapcarta.

   Moya Marin visited a Tesla service center in the city in April and said
   she wants companies to stay to grow the local economy.

   “It is up to the governments to create the right conditions to attract
   new investments and that companies like Tesla, which have already
   invested in our municipality, remain and increase their participation
   in the national market, for the creation of new jobs and reactivate the
   regional economy,” Tesmanian reported the mayor saying during the
   visit.

     * A growing number of protestors condemning the murders of George
       Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, David McAtee and many other
       Black people are calling to defund the police, a concept long
       championed by advocates as a response to police brutality and
       anti-Black racism.
     * Activists define defunding the police as relocating public funds
       away from policing, and towards community resources.
     * Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was asked about defunding the police on

     __________________________________________________________________

   Advocates working to deconstruct police brutality and anti-Black racism
   have long called to defund the police, and in the wake of the murders
   of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, David McAtee and many
   other Black people by police, the concept has become a rallying cry
   among protestors. Activists and community organizations define
   defunding the police as moving public funds away from policing and
   incarceration, and investing instead in community resources.

   After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek
   Chauvin, organizations Black Visions and Reclaim the Block—which have
   long worked to defund the Minneapolis Police Department—launched a
   petition to the Minneapolis City Council. The petition called on
   council members to commit to four key aspects of defunding the police:

   1. To never again vote to increase police funding or to increase the
   police department's budget.

   2. To propose and vote for a $45 million cut from MPD's budget as the
   City responds to projected COVID-19 shortfalls.

   3. To protect and expand current investment in community-led health and
   safety strategies, instead of investing in police.

   4. To do everything in my power to compel MPD and all law enforcement
   agencies to immediately cease enacting violence on community members.”

   The Guardian reports that at a subsequent community rally, the council
   "pledged to disband the city’s police department and replace it with a
   new system of public safety.”

   The Movement for Black Lives defines their "Invest-Divest" platform
   (opens in new tab) thus: "We demand investments in the education,
   health and safety of Black people, instead of investments in the
   criminalizing, caging, and harming of Black people. We want investments
   in Black communities, determined by Black communities, and divestment
   from exploitative forces including prisons, fossil fuels, police,
   surveillance and exploitative corporations." (Donate to Movement for
   Black Lives here. (opens in new tab))

   Black Lives Matter, which launched a petition to #DefundThePolice
   (opens in new tab), explained, "George Floyd’s violent death was a
   breaking point—an all too familiar reminder that, for Black people, law
   enforcement doesn’t protect or save our lives. They often threaten and
   take them." The petition reads, "We call for a national defunding of
   police. We demand investment in our communities and the resources to
   ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive."

     .@AOC's answer to "what does defund the police look like?" was "a
     suburb" and that is totally gonna be my answer from now on

   Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the proponents of the
   call to defund the police, and a recent post on her Instagram story on
   the subject quickly went viral, after it was screenshotted and shared
   by Twitter user Ashley Quan. Asked, "What does an America with defunded
   police look like to you?" Ocasio-Cortez responded, "It looks like a
   suburb."

   "Affluent white communities already live in a world where the choose to
   fund youth, health, housing etc more than they fund police,"
   Ocasio-Cortez explained. "When a teenager or preteen does something
   harmful in a suburb (I say teen bc this is often where lifelong
   carceral cycles begin for Black and Brown communities), White
   communities bend over backwards to find alternatives to incarceration
   for their loved ones to 'protect their future,' like community service
   or rehab or restorative measures. Why don't we treat Black and Brown
   people the same way?

   "Why doesn't the criminal system care about Black teens' futures the
   way they care for White teens' futures?" AOC continued. "Why doesn't
   the news use Black people's graduation or family photos in stories the
   way they do when they cover White people (eg Brock Turner) who commit
   harmful crimes?"

Read Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's full response to the question,
"What does an America with defunded police look like to you?" below:

   The good news is that it actually doesn't take a ton of imagination.

   It looks like a suburb. Affluent white communities already live in a
   world where the choose to fund youth, health, housing etc more than
   they fund police. These communities have lower crime rates not because
   they have more police, but bc they have more resources to support
   healthy society in a way that reduces crime.

   When a teenager or preteen does something harmful in a suburb (I say
   teen bc this is often where lifelong carceral cycles begin for Black
   and Brown communities), White communities bend over backwards to find
   alternatives to incarceration for their loved ones to "protect their
   future," like community service or rehab or restorative measures. Why
   don't we treat Black and Brown people the same way? Why doesn't the
   criminal system care about Black teens' futures the way they care for
   White teens' futures? Why doesn't the news use Black people's
   graduation or family photos in stories the way they do when they cover
   White people (eg Brock Turner) who commit harmful crimes? Affluent
   White suburbs also design their own lives so that they walk through the
   world without having much interruption or interaction with police at
   all aside from community events and speeding tickets (and many of these
   communities try to reduce those, too!)

   Just starting THERE would be a dramatically and radically different
   world than what we are experiencing now.

   A one-and-half-year-old girl was attacked and killed by a leopard in
   the forested area of Aarey colony in the western suburb of Goregaon
   here on Monday, police said.

   The incident took place in unit number 15 of Aarey around 6.30 am, when
   the child followed her mother who was on her way to a temple around 30
   feet from their house, an official from Aarey police station said.

   A leopard attacked the girl and injured her. The toddler was rushed to
   a hospital, where she was declared dead by doctors, he said.

   ''On the basis of primary information, we have registered an accidental
   death report (ADR) in the case, further investigation is underway,''
   the official added. Meanwhile, the forest department has initiated an
   action plan to prevent the human-wildlife conflict in the area, an
   official said.

   A team from Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) has been
   called in by the forest department for assistance, he said.

   The authorities have deployed a wildlife ambulance, wildlife distress
   response teams from the Mumbai forest department and volunteers in the
   area, the official said.

   Rescuers, leopard experts, veterinarians and senior officials from the
   forest department will be stationed at Aarey round the clock for this
   entire week, he said.

   Night patrolling will be done and camera traps will be installed to
   identify and monitor the movements of the big cat, the official said.

   Located near Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Aarey is considered the green
   lung of Mumbai and has witnessed several attacks by leopards in the
   past.

Armed French police sent into Dijon to quell ethnic gang violence

   By Reuters Staff

   2 Min Read
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   PARIS (Reuters) - Armed police were sent into a suburb of Dijon in
   eastern France to restore order after score-settling between rival
   gangs resulted in a fourth night of street violence.

   Trouble erupted on Friday when some 100 Chechen youths from across
   France descended on the Dijon suburb of Gresilles to avenge an attack
   on a Chechen teenager earlier in the week, police officials said.

   Gresilles is a low-income neighbourhood with a heavy North African
   immigrant population. A Dijon police source described the ethnic
   Chechens as heavily armed and said they had told local law enforcement
   they had come “to clean things up”.

   Deputy interior minister Laurent Nunez travelled to Dijon and said the
   violence must end. He denied police had been slow to intervene, praised
   their courage, and said reinforcements would remain in the city as long
   as needed.

   Regional radio station France Bleu quoted Dijon prosecutor Eric Mathias
   as saying he had opened an investigation into attempted murder by an
   organised group and incitement to violence.

   Mathias said Chechens had allegedly used social media to issue a
   France-wide call for retaliation against the Maghreb community in
   Gresilles.

   Videos, whose provenance Reuters could not immediately authenticate,
   circulated at the weekend showing dozens of hooded Chechen men, some
   wearing balaclavas and brandishing handguns or knives, out in the
   streets of the Dijon suburb.

   “We’re no longer in a (functioning) Republic when that is how things
   play out,” Dijon mayor Francois Rebsamen told BFM TV, denouncing a lack
   of police resources in provincial cities.

   Stephan Ragonneau, regional secretary of the national Alliance Police
   union, told Reuters the Chechens were “very mobile, very organised,
   armed (and) hooded”.

   “It would have been dangerous to intervene (earlier),” Ragonneau said.
   “If it had kicked off, there would have been shooting everywhere. There
   would certainly have been injuries, deaths.”

   WA police have vowed to crack down on criminal gangs following a fatal
   shooting in the northern Perth suburb of Gnangara yesterday, with
   detectives confirming the victim had links to bikie members.

Key points:

     * Police found a man dead at a workshop in Gnangara about 4pm on
       Thursday
     * The gang crime squad is assisting the homicide squad with their
       inquiries
     * Police believe the shooting was targeted and the shooter poses no
       threat to the community

   A 34-year-old man was found dead at a workshop premises on Sydney Road
   after being shot.

   Police say investigations are ongoing and no arrests have yet been
   made, but they reassured there was no active threat to the community,
   as it was a targeted attack.

   Commissioner Col Blanch said a number of search warrants had already
   been carried out, with more to come, to "send a clear message to those
   in the community that want to commit these acts of violence that it is
   not tolerated".

   "If people think that they can, in cold blood, shoot people in Western
   Australia, then the police will be coming for them."

'Toughest bikie and firearms laws in the nation'

   Police Minister Paul Papalia reiterated that Western Australia will
   continue to crack down hard on gang-related crime.

   "This type of act is exactly why the government is giving the Western
   Australian police the toughest bikie and firearms laws in the nation,"
   the minister said.

   As well as recent amendments to the firearm act and consorting
   legislation, Minister Papalia said the government was also working on
   amendments to the surveillance devices act and the criminal
   investigation act "to enable police to more effectively target outlaw
   motorcycle gangs and organised crime".

   Commissioner Blanch issued a direct warning to criminal gangs: "If you
   get out of line, you start doing things like this, then the gang crime
   squad will come for you".

Police appeal for witnesses

   Neighbours reported hearing several gunshots and say they saw both a
   car and a motorcycle leaving the scene shortly afterwards.

   The property where the shooting took place is a warehouse, which
   neighbours say is a shared workspace used by mechanics.

   The area is semi-rural, with small farms immediately surrounding the
   warehouse.

   Police are asking for anyone who was in the area between 1pm and 4pm on
   Thursday afternoon that might have information or any CCTV, dashcam or
   mobile phone footage, to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

   A 21-year-old man was allegedly attacked and killed by three minor
   boys, after he stopped one of them from bursting a firecracker in a
   glass bottle on an open ground in the eastern suburb of Govandi here on
   Monday, police said. The police have detained two of the boys, aged 14
   and 15, while another accused who is 12 years old is absconding, an
   official said.

   The incident took place in Shivaji Nagar area of Govandi in the
   afternoon, he said.

   The victim had spotted the 12-year-old boy placing a firecracker in a
   glass bottle to burst it and intervened, the official said.

   An argument ensued between the two and the other two accused started
   beating up the victim. The 12-year-old boy then attacked the man with a
   sharp weapon and stabbed him in the neck, he said.

   The injured man was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared
   dead, the official said.

Constance Watcho's death is unspeakable, yet it isn't listed as a homicide

   Tarita Fisher had a horrible, sinking feeling in the pit of her
   stomach.

   In the final months of 2017, her sister-in-law Constance Watcho had
   gone quiet.

   No-one had seen or heard from her in weeks — not her kids, her brothers
   or anyone in her large family network across Brisbane and central
   Queensland.

   Constance, or Connie as she was affectionately known, was a funny,
   strong-willed and loving mother-of-10, says Tarita.

   The 36-year-old had been living in Brisbane for the past few years and
   had had a difficult life, but her disappearance was completely out of
   character.

   "For her to be vanished — she just vanished — that's not Constance.
   It's not Constance," Tarita says.

   "I said to one of [her] brothers at the time, I said, 'Look, this is
   unusual. She needs to be listed as a missing person. This isn't
   normal.'"

   character.(Supplied)

   Her brothers and one of her teenage sons made the trip from their
   small, neighbouring communities of Cherbourg and Murgon down to
   Brisbane to search for her.

   "Just asking people on the street if they knew any stories, where she'd
   been, what happened. I just knew something wasn't right," says
   Constance's son Orlyn.

   It was clear from their own search efforts that she was nowhere to be
   found, and so the family reported her missing on February 8, 2018.

'Aboriginal women don't just go missing'

   Tarita Fisher, Constance's friend and sister-in-law, says when
   Aboriginal women go missing it means something is seriously wrong.(Four
   Corners: Suzanne Dredge)

   The Coroners Court would later hear that just two days after her family
   went to police, officers had assessed Constance's case as
   "medium-risk".

   The risk assessment for a missing person's report is crucial, according
   to research by the Australian Institute of Criminology, because it is
   the central mechanism by which police resources are then allocated.

The killings and disappearances that we don’t even count

   One group of Australian women are being murdered up to 12 times the
   national average. Why isn't it being treated as a crisis?

   "She wasn't medium-risk. That's their terminology. When an Aboriginal
   woman goes missing in our communities, it's high-risk," Tarita says.

   "When someone goes missing, there's something seriously wrong … because
   Aboriginal women don't just go missing. They don't just disappear or go
   into hiding."

   Tarita often reflects on why Constance's case has received little
   national attention.

   "It's a Black woman gone missing, disappeared off the face of the Earth
   and no one could locate her. The only people that cared was her
   family."

An unspeakable crime in plain sight

   On a bright, beautiful morning, as ferries whizzed by on the Brisbane
   River, police officers waded through overgrown weeds and grass to
   reveal an unspeakable crime.

   In the wealthy inner-city suburb of Kangaroo Point, near a busy walking
   track at the base of a cliff, Constance's body was discovered in a
   sports bag, hidden in plain sight.

   It's September 10, 2018, and by now she had been missing for almost 10

   It was evident to police that Constance's body had been completely
   dehumanised: dismembered, disarticulated at the joints and partially
   stuffed into a bag.

   Some of her bones were strewn about the grass. Her bra was still intact
   around her torso and shoulder bones.

   It would later be revealed at a coronial inquest that the man who
   discovered her body and reported it to police was one of the last
   people to have seen Constance alive.

'We think it's your Mum'

   Orlyn says he found out about his mum's death from police, moments
   before they held a press conference.

   "They just told me what they found and just [said] 'We think it's your
   mum,' and [they] just said it's going to be on the news in 30 seconds.
   I hung up the phone," he says.

   "I cried and went quiet for months."

   Tarita broke the news to two of Constance's other children, Rose and
   Michael, who were still in high school at the time.

   Satellite imagery revealed that Constance's body had lain in the same
   spot for at least six months — in the same suburb where she was last
   seen alive.

   It's a startling revelation: all this time her body had been barely
   concealed just 200 metres from where Constance had been staying.

   Police would later tell an inquest: "If the remains were located
   sooner, this would have assisted us greatly in so far as establishing a
   cause of death."

   The discovery of her mother's body was shattering for Constance's
   daughter Rose, who began questioning whether a thorough search of the
   area had ever been carried out by police.

   "My mother was found 200 metres from the last place she was seen, in a
   place where a lot of people walk by. That part of the investigation I
   feel wasn't conducted properly," she says.

   "I do see a lot of things on the news — white women going missing [and]
   getting found, a proper investigation into what happened. It's not like
   that with my mother."

   During the inquest, the Queensland Police Force says it invested
   significant resources into the investigation into Constance's
   disappearance and death, which included checking interstate police
   databases and accessing bank records.

Police had 'no working theories' on what happened

   Police told a coronial inquest last month they had "no working
   theories" about what happened to her.

   The inquest heard that a man had approached police near his home to
   tell them he had found the bag at the cliffs.

   Media reports at the time referred to the man as a "member of the
   public".

   In fact, Constance had been living with him, along with her boyfriend
   Przemyslaw "Sam" Sobczak, and a third man, Dallas Bandman.

   Queensland Police told the inquest that the three men were persons of
   interest in the case and that "versions provided by all those three
   [men] are conflicting with each other, and also with previous versions
   given by them."

Constance seen arguing with boyfriend, coroner hears

   Dallas Bandman told the Coroners Court that he last saw Constance
   arguing with her boyfriend, Mr Sobczak, near the Kangaroo Point flats
   where they all lived, on November 27, 2017.

   Mr Bandman was read a portion of his statement to police about what
   happened next.

   "I remember thinking enough is enough, and I went outside and told them
   to piss off. They didn't say anything, they just walked off," he was
   quoted as saying.

   However, Mr Bandman told the inquest that after he had asked them to
   leave, he had actually gone back inside the flat and bundled up sheets
   and pillows and stuffed them into a bag, before giving it to Constance
   and Mr Sobczak.

   When shown a photograph of the bag that had contained Constance's
   remains, he said it had belonged to him and that it was the same bag he
   had given the pair the night he kicked them out.

   He was asked why he hadn't told police this important detail in his
   statement.

   "I just want to clarify that not everything I said to police is in the
   statement," Mr Bandman said.

   Mr Bandman then told the inquest that Mr Sobczak had returned to the
   flat the next day.

   "He [Mr Sobczak] had two black eyes. Swollen black eyes. Maybe a scruff
   mark on his face, on his chest maybe. Looked like he'd been in a
   fight."

   Constance Watcho.   (Four Corners: Stephanie Zillman)

   When Mr Bandman asked where Constance was, he says Mr Sobczak replied,
   "f*** off".

   Mr Bandman strongly denied any involvement in the disappearance and
   death of Constance.

   "She was a friend of mine and I didn't hurt her," he said.

   At the inquest, Mr Sobczak answered "I don't know" and "I don't
   remember" to dozens of questions, and replied "No" when asked if he had
   anything to do with her death.

   Mr Sobczak will return to give evidence when the inquest resumes.

'Show her children what happened to her'

   Darumbal and South Sea Islander journalist and academic Amy McQuire has
   been closely following the inquest.

   "Her family felt that there was an urgency to find her," she says.

   "The fact that Constance was found so close to where she was last seen
   — that's something that has never been properly answered.

   "There was just this total apathy."

   The coroner heard Constance's case is deemed a "suspicious death"
   because police have said a cause of death cannot be determined.

   "Show her children the outcomes. Show her children the truths of what
   happened to her. There's got to be some answer to this," Tarita says.

   Her loved ones have multiple unanswered questions over whether
   Queensland Police have conducted a meaningful investigation.

   "For someone else, it would have been quick to solve. It's been years
   now and they still haven't done anything," says Constance's son
   Michael.

   Four Corners sent a detailed list of questions to the Queensland Police
   Force regarding the investigation into Ms Watcho's death.

   A spokesperson says the force is committed to "enhancing its
   capability" to protect victims of violence but that it would be
   inappropriate to comment further while Ms Watcho's inquest is ongoing.

A silent crisis

   Amy McQuire says there is a pattern of ongoing violence towards
   Indigenous women stretching back decades.

   "Aboriginal women are largely [seen as] just passive and bodies for
   which acts of violence are done to," she tells Four Corners.

   "And I think that's a real reason why this crisis has been silenced for
   so long … media and society haven't been listening."

   No-one knows how many First Nations women have disappeared over the
   decades, but Four Corners has established at least 49 missing cases
   across Australia since 1941.

   Many of these women's families have spent several years pushing for
   better search efforts, more rigorous investigations, and increased
   media attention to unsolved cases of missing Aboriginal women.

   It's taken more than four years for Ms Watcho's case to go before the
   Queensland coroners court.

   Last month, Constance's family made the difficult decision to sit
   through five days of hearings.

   They also held a moving and emotional ceremony for her at the base of
   the cliff where her body was found.

   Constance's eldest children are growing up in Murgon, not far from
   where she was raised in Cherbourg.

   Their Mum is now buried at the Cherbourg cemetery where her grave is
   adorned with purple flowers — her favourite colour.

   "I just miss her and love her," Michael says.

   "I'll never give up on her and I know that she's with me everywhere I
   go."

   British police and prosecutors on Saturday said they had charged a
   34-year-man with the August murder of a nine-year-old girl shot dead at
   her home in Liverpool, northwest England.

   Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest on August 22 when the
   perpetrator’s intended target burst into her house to try to escape his
   attacker, in what has been described as a suspected gang war incident.

   the app.

   Her death -- the third fatal shooting in the city within a week at the
   time -- shocked the country and prompted calls for greater action to
   tackle gun and organized crime.

   In a statement, Merseyside Police said Thomas Cashman, from the
   Liverpool suburb of West Derby, had been charged with the young girl’s
   murder “following an extensive and complex investigation.”

   The force has also charged him with the attempted murders of the girl's
   mother Cheryl Korbel and Joseph Nee, a convicted burglar, according to
   the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which brings charges in England
   and Wales.

   Cashman faces a further two counts of possession of a firearm with
   intent to endanger life.

   Paul Russell, 40, from the same suburb, has been charged with assisting
   an offender, police added.

   Both men will appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court on Monday.

   The CPS said it had authorized the charges “following a review of a
   file of evidence received from Merseyside Police.”

   Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Kameen said its probe “continues in
   earnest.”

   “I would ask for your continued support so we can keep the promise we
   made to Olivia’s family and the local community to ensure that those
   involved face justice,” he added, noting the response so far had been
   “overwhelming.”

   Kameen said those still sought included “the people who have tried to
   shield and protect individuals, and those who have supplied the weapon
   or are hiding the weapons used in this incident.”

High praise for locals as police return to Wainuiomata after 10-year hiatus

   Area commander Dion Bennett at the reopening of the Wanuiomata Police
   Station on Tuesday.

   After a 10-year hiatus, Wainuiomata has a police station again, though
   the community was so effective at driving parliamentary protesters out
   of the Lower Hutt suburb earlier this year, police are joking they may
   not have much to do.

   When the anti-mandate protesters were driven off parliamentary grounds
   in March, many went to Wainuiomata hoping to occupy the marae. Instead,
   they were met by locals who made it clear they were not welcome.

   So when Te Awa Kairangi ​Hutt Valley area commander Dion Bennett​ was
   in Wainuiomata on Tuesday to reopen the police station which closed 10
   years ago.

   He joked he “doubted” the community needed a police presence after the
   locals chased the protesters away. The response was “magic” and showed
   what a community could achieve by working together.

   Bennett said returning it to a working station had not been straight
   forward. After 10 years, it required expensive modernising and there
   were also issues around staff safety.

   Locals had made it clear, there was a strong desire to have the police
   back in the rapidly growing suburb, he said.

   It would be open to the public on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons.

   Staff had been chosen for their strong background in community policing
   and he hoped their presence would build trust in the community.

   The Wainuiomata Police Station reopening has been welcomed by locals.

   The Wainuiomata Police Station reopening has been welcomed by locals.

   Hutt South MP Ginny Andersen, who had previously worked for the police,
   said it was clear public trust and confidence grew when police had a
   presence.

   Mayor Campbell Barry thanked Bennett for listening to locals.

   “What you are doing here today is sending a strong message about the
   importance of community policing and we really appreciate that.”

   Wellington District Commander of the Māori Wardens Gabriel Tupou​ said
   having police based in Wainuiomata was a major step forward.

   Sergeant Patrick Tangipo has lived in Wainuiomata for 17 years.

   Sergeant Patrick Tangipo has lived in Wainuiomata for 17 years.

   A public meeting in November 2020 over youth crime and gang tensions
   had highlighted the need for local police.

   The wardens were one of a number of community groups that would use the
   station, which would help build their presence in the community.

   Wainuiomata Marae manager Linda Olsen​ was “absolutely delighted” to
   have police back in the suburb.

   The marae preferred to work with local police and she was glad that she
   could now report problems, rather than ringing 105.

   The station will be run by Sergeant Patrick (Pat) Tangipo​, a
   Wainuiomata resident of 17 years.

   Appointed in February, he said it had been a slow process reopening the
   building and finding staff, especially when he was diverted away to
   deal with the parliamentary occupation.

   He was aware of unhappiness over the original closure and he said
   rebuilding relationships would be his first priority.

   “I will hold people accountable, but my preferred style of policing is
   to work with whānau in the community and set them up with the tools to
   be safe and feel safe.

   “I believe this can only be done by being in the community with
   whānau.”
